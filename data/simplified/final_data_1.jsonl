It deals with the depredations of London Bridge and attempts , realistic or fanciful , to repair it . It may date back to bridge rhymes and games of the Late Middle Ages , but the earliest records of the rhyme in English are from the seventeenth century . The lyrics were first printed in close to their modern form in the mid-eighteenth century and became popular , particularly in Britain and the United States during the 19th century . </P> <P> The modern melody was first recorded in the late nineteenth century and the game resembles arch games of the Middle Ages , but seems to have taken its modern form in the late nineteenth century . It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 502 . Several theories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme and the identity of the `` fair lady '' of the refrain . The rhyme is one of the best known in the world and has been referenced in a variety of works of literature and popular culture . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Lyrics </Li> <Li> 2 Melody </Li> <Li> 3 The game </Li> <Li> 4 Origins </Li> <Li> 5 Meaning <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Viking attack theory </Li> <Li> 5.2 Child sacrifice theory </Li> <Li> 5.3 Age and damage theory </Li> <Li> 5.4 `` Fair lady '' identity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Legacy and popular culture </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Lyrics ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> London Bridge Is Falling Down Tune for London Bridge Is Falling Down </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Problems playing this file ? See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> London Bridge ( 1616 ) by Claes Van Visscher A prospect of Old London Bridge in 1710 . New London Bridge in the late 19th century . The reconstructed New London Bridge in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . The modern concrete London Bridge . <P> There is considerable variation in the lyrics of the rhyme . The most frequently used first verse is : </P> <P> London Bridge is falling down , Falling down , falling down . London Bridge is falling down , My fair lady . </P> <P> In the version quoted by Iona and Peter Opie in 1951 the first verse is : </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down , Broken down , broken down . London Bridge is broken down , My fair lady . </P> <P> The rhyme is constructed of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic , ( each line made up of four metrical feet of two syllables , with the stress falling on the first syllable in a pair ; the last foot in the line missing the unstressed syllable ) , which is common in nursery rhymes . In its most common form it relies on a double repetition , rather than a rhyming scheme , which is a frequently employed device in children 's rhymes and stories . The Roud Folk Song Index , which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number , classifies the song as 502 . </P> <H2> Melody ( edit ) </H2> The melody now most associated with the rhyme . <P> A melody is recorded for `` London Bridge '' in an edition of John Playford 's The Dancing Master published in 1718 , but it differs from the modern tune and no lyrics were given . An issue of Blackwood 's Magazine in 1821 noted the rhyme as a being sung to the tune of `` Nancy Dawson '' , now better known as `` Nuts in May '' and the same tune was given in Richard Thomson 's Chronicles of London Bridge ( 1827 ) . </P> <P> Another tune was recorded in Samuel Arnold 's Juvenile Amusements in 1797 . E.F. Rimbault 's Nursery Rhymes ( 1836 ) has the same first line , but then a different tune . The tune now associated with the rhyme was first recorded in 1879 in the US in A.H. Rosewig 's Illustrated National Songs and Games . </P> <H2> The game ( edit ) </H2> Girls playing `` London Bridge '' in 1898 . <P> The rhyme is often used in a children 's singing game , which exists in a wide variety of forms , with additional verses . Most versions are similar to the actions used in the rhyme `` Oranges and Lemons '' . The most common is that two players hold hands and make an arch with their arms while the others pass through in single file . The `` arch '' is then lowered at the song 's end to `` catch '' a player . In the United States it is common for two teams of those that have been caught to engage in a tug of war . In England until the nineteenth century the song may have been accompanied by a circle dance , but arch games are known to have been common across late medieval Europe . </P> <P> Five of nine versions published by Alice Gomme in 1894 included references to a prisoner who has stolen a watch and chain . This may be a late nineteenth century addition from another game called `` Hark the Robbers '' , or `` Watch and Chain '' . This rhyme is sung to the same tune and may be an offshoot of `` London Bridge '' or the remnant of a distinct game . In one version the first two verses have the lyrics : </P> <P> Who has stole my watch and chain , Watch and chain , watch and chain ; Who has stole my watch and chain , My fair lady ? Off to prison you must go , You must go , you must go ; Off to prison you must go , My fair lady . </P> This 1904 column from the Tacoma Times describes various alternate verses and their accompanying gestures <H2> Origins ( edit ) </H2> Detail from Philippe Pigouchet 's Heures a lusaige de Paris ( 1497 ) , showing an arch game similar to that known to be associated with the rhyme from the late nineteenth century . The cover of the third edition of Dumpling and Pudding , which contains Henry Carey 's satire `` Namby Pamby '' ( 1725 ) , one of the earliest surviving works to refer to the rhyme . <P> Similar rhymes can be found across Europe , pre-dating the records in England . These include `` Knippelsbro Går Op og Ned '' from Denmark , `` Die Magdeburger Brück '' from Germany , `` pont chus '' from sixteenth - century France ; and `` Le porte '' , from fourteenth - century Italy . It is possible that the rhyme was acquired from one of these sources and then adapted to fit the most famous bridge in England . </P> <P> One of the earliest references to the rhyme in English is in the comedy The London Chaunticleres , printed in 1657 , but probably written about 1636 , in which the dairy woman Curds states that she had `` danced the building of London - Bridge '' at the Whitsun Ales in her youth , although no words or actions are mentioned . Widespread familiarity with the rhyme is suggested by its use by Henry Carey in his satire Namby Pamby ( 1725 ) , as : </P> <P> Namby Pamby is no Clown , </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down : Now he courts the gay Ladee Dancing o'er The Lady - Lee . </P> <P> The oldest extant version could be that recalled by a correspondent to the Gentleman 's Magazine in 1823 , which he claimed to have heard from a woman who was a child in the reign of Charles II ( r . 1660 -- 85 ) and had the lyrics : </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down , Dance over the Lady Lea ; London Bridge is broken down , With a gay lady ( la - dee ) . </P> <P> The earliest printed English version is in the oldest extant collection of nursery rhymes , Tommy Thumb 's Pretty Song Book , printed by John Newbery in London ( c. 1744 ) , beginning with the following text : </P> The first page of the rhyme from an 1815 edition of Tommy Thumb 's Pretty Song Book ( c. 1744 ) . James Ritson , whose Gammer Gurton 's Garland contains one of the earliest versions of the rhyme ( Engraving by James Sayers , published in 1803 ) . <P> London Bridge Is Broken down , Dance over my Lady Lee . London Bridge Is Broken down With a gay Lady . </P> <P> A version from James Ritson 's Gammer Gurton 's Garland ( 1784 ) is similar but replaces the last verse with : </P> <P> Build it up with stone so strong , Dance o'er my Lady lee , Huzza ! ' twill last for ages long , With a gay lady . </P> <H2> Meaning ( edit ) </H2> Cnut the Great 's men on the London bridge , under attack by Olaf II of Norway from a Victorian children 's book published in 1894 . <P> The meaning of the rhyme is not certain . It may simply relate to the many difficulties experienced in bridging the River Thames , but a number of alternative theories have been put forward . </P> <H3> Viking attack theory ( edit ) </H3> <P> One theory of origin is that the rhyme relates to the supposed destruction of London Bridge by Olaf II of Norway in 1014 ( or 1009 ) . The nineteenth - century translation of the Norse saga the Heimskringla , published by Samuel Laing in 1844 , included a verse by Óttarr svarti , that looks very similar to the nursery rhyme : </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down . -- Gold is won , and bright renown . Shields resounding , War - horns sounding , Hild is shouting in the din ! Arrows singing , Mail - coats ringing -- Odin makes our Olaf win ! </P> <P> However , modern translations make it clear that Laing was using the nursery rhyme as a model for his very free translation , and the reference to London Bridge does not appear at the start of the verse and it is unlikely that this is an earlier version of the nursery rhyme . Some historians have raised the possibility that the attack never took place . However , the original document detailing the attack was written only about 100 years after what would be a famous event in a highly populated area , leading the majority of historians to conclude that the account is at least relatively accurate . While it might or might not be the origin of the rhyme , this would make King Olaf 's victory the only historically recorded incidence of London Bridge `` falling down . '' </P> <H3> Child sacrifice theory ( edit ) </H3> Detail of the Great Fire of London 1666 by an unknown painter . The Tower of London is on the right and London Bridge on the left . <P> The theory that the song refers to the burying , perhaps alive , of children in the foundations of the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha Gomme ( later Lady Gomme ) in The Traditional Games of England , Scotland and Ireland ( 1894 -- 1898 ) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie . This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice , who will then watch over the bridge . However , there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in the foundations of London Bridge . </P> <H3> Age and damage theory ( edit ) </H3> <P> Until the mid-eighteenth century the Old London Bridge was the only crossing on the Thames in London . It was damaged in a major fire in 1633 , but in the fire of 1666 this damage acted as a fire break and prevented the flames from further damaging the bridge and crossing to the south side of the Thames . With its 19 narrow arches , it impeded river traffic and flow . Central piers were removed to create a wider navigational span . Widening and the removal of its houses was completed in 1763 , but it remained relatively narrow and needed continual and expensive repairs . In the early nineteenth century it was decided to replace the bridge with a new construction . New London Bridge was opened in 1831 and survived until it was replaced in 1972 . It was then transported and reconstructed in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . </P> <H3> `` Fair lady '' identity ( edit ) </H3> The seal of Matilda of Scotland , one of the candidates for the `` fair lady '' of the refrain . <P> Several attempts have been made to identify the ' fair lady ' , ' lady gay ' , or lady ' lee / lea ' of the rhyme . They include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Matilda of Scotland ( c. 1080 -- 1118 ) Henry I 's consort , who between 1110 and 1118 was responsible for the building of the series of bridges that carried the London - Colchester road across the River Lea and its side streams between Bow and Stratford . </Li> <Li> Eleanor of Provence ( c. 1223 -- 91 ) , consort of Henry III who had custody of the bridge revenues from 1269 to about 1281 . </Li> <Li> A member of the Leigh family of Stoneleigh Park , Warwickshire , who have a family story that a human sacrifice lies under the building . </Li> <Li> The River Lea , which is a tributary of the Thames . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Legacy and popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <P> Since the late 19th century the rhyme has been seen as one of the most popular and well known in the English - speaking world . It has also been referenced in both literature and popular culture . </P> <Ul> <Li> It was used by T.S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land ( 1922 ) . </Li> <Li> The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe 's 1956 musical My Fair Lady . </Li> <Li> Chorus of the 1963 Brenda Lee song My Whole World is Falling Down are based on `` London Bridge is Falling Down '' . </Li> <Li> The musical unicorn - in - glass - dome ornament bought by William Foster in the 1993 movie Falling Down plays the tune of the nursery rhyme `` London Bridge is falling down '' . ( So the movie title is evidently derived from this old nursery rhyme . ) </Li> <Li> The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants . </Li> <Li> In 1982 was sampled as `` Halloween Montage '' by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth feat . Tommy Lee Wallace , for the film Halloween III : Season of the Witch , who was used as a song of the Silver Shamrock commercial . </Li> <Li> In The Inbetweeners episode Bunk Off , Simon expresses about losing his virginity to Carli and Jay teases him about the prospect of that - and part of this teasing is riding Simon on Neil 's dad 's sofa and singing about intercourse with Carli to the tune of London Bridge is Falling Down . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Children 's literature portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Dong , Dong , Dongdaemun , a similar Korean nursery rhyme . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : London Bridge Is Falling Down </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to London Bridge Is Falling Down . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : I.
