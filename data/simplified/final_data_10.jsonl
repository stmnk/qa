It deals with the depredations of London Bridge and attempts , realistic or fanciful , to repair it . It may date back to bridge rhymes and games of the Late Middle Ages , but the earliest records of the rhyme in English are from the seventeenth century . The lyrics were first printed in close to their modern form in the mid-eighteenth century and became popular , particularly in Britain and the United States during the 19th century . </P> <P> The modern melody was first recorded in the late nineteenth century and the game resembles arch games of the Middle Ages , but seems to have taken its modern form in the late nineteenth century . It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 502 . Several theories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme and the identity of the `` fair lady '' of the refrain . The rhyme is one of the best known in the world and has been referenced in a variety of works of literature and popular culture . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Lyrics </Li> <Li> 2 Melody </Li> <Li> 3 The game </Li> <Li> 4 Origins </Li> <Li> 5 Meaning <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Viking attack theory </Li> <Li> 5.2 Child sacrifice theory </Li> <Li> 5.3 Age and damage theory </Li> <Li> 5.4 `` Fair lady '' identity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Legacy and popular culture </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Lyrics ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> London Bridge Is Falling Down Tune for London Bridge Is Falling Down </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Problems playing this file ? See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> London Bridge ( 1616 ) by Claes Van Visscher A prospect of Old London Bridge in 1710 . New London Bridge in the late 19th century . The reconstructed New London Bridge in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . The modern concrete London Bridge . <P> There is considerable variation in the lyrics of the rhyme . The most frequently used first verse is : </P> <P> London Bridge is falling down , Falling down , falling down . London Bridge is falling down , My fair lady . </P> <P> In the version quoted by Iona and Peter Opie in 1951 the first verse is : </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down , Broken down , broken down . London Bridge is broken down , My fair lady . </P> <P> The rhyme is constructed of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic , ( each line made up of four metrical feet of two syllables , with the stress falling on the first syllable in a pair ; the last foot in the line missing the unstressed syllable ) , which is common in nursery rhymes . In its most common form it relies on a double repetition , rather than a rhyming scheme , which is a frequently employed device in children 's rhymes and stories . The Roud Folk Song Index , which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number , classifies the song as 502 . </P> <H2> Melody ( edit ) </H2> The melody now most associated with the rhyme . <P> A melody is recorded for `` London Bridge '' in an edition of John Playford 's The Dancing Master published in 1718 , but it differs from the modern tune and no lyrics were given . An issue of Blackwood 's Magazine in 1821 noted the rhyme as a being sung to the tune of `` Nancy Dawson '' , now better known as `` Nuts in May '' and the same tune was given in Richard Thomson 's Chronicles of London Bridge ( 1827 ) . </P> <P> Another tune was recorded in Samuel Arnold 's Juvenile Amusements in 1797 . E.F. Rimbault 's Nursery Rhymes ( 1836 ) has the same first line , but then a different tune . The tune now associated with the rhyme was first recorded in 1879 in the US in A.H. Rosewig 's Illustrated National Songs and Games . </P> <H2> The game ( edit ) </H2> Girls playing `` London Bridge '' in 1898 . <P> The rhyme is often used in a children 's singing game , which exists in a wide variety of forms , with additional verses . Most versions are similar to the actions used in the rhyme `` Oranges and Lemons '' . The most common is that two players hold hands and make an arch with their arms while the others pass through in single file . The `` arch '' is then lowered at the song 's end to `` catch '' a player . In the United States it is common for two teams of those that have been caught to engage in a tug of war . In England until the nineteenth century the song may have been accompanied by a circle dance , but arch games are known to have been common across late medieval Europe . </P> <P> Five of nine versions published by Alice Gomme in 1894 included references to a prisoner who has stolen a watch and chain . This may be a late nineteenth century addition from another game called `` Hark the Robbers '' , or `` Watch and Chain '' . This rhyme is sung to the same tune and may be an offshoot of `` London Bridge '' or the remnant of a distinct game . In one version the first two verses have the lyrics : </P> <P> Who has stole my watch and chain , Watch and chain , watch and chain ; Who has stole my watch and chain , My fair lady ? Off to prison you must go , You must go , you must go ; Off to prison you must go , My fair lady . </P> This 1904 column from the Tacoma Times describes various alternate verses and their accompanying gestures <H2> Origins ( edit ) </H2> Detail from Philippe Pigouchet 's Heures a lusaige de Paris ( 1497 ) , showing an arch game similar to that known to be associated with the rhyme from the late nineteenth century . The cover of the third edition of Dumpling and Pudding , which contains Henry Carey 's satire `` Namby Pamby '' ( 1725 ) , one of the earliest surviving works to refer to the rhyme . <P> Similar rhymes can be found across Europe , pre-dating the records in England . These include `` Knippelsbro Går Op og Ned '' from Denmark , `` Die Magdeburger Brück '' from Germany , `` pont chus '' from sixteenth - century France ; and `` Le porte '' , from fourteenth - century Italy . It is possible that the rhyme was acquired from one of these sources and then adapted to fit the most famous bridge in England . </P> <P> One of the earliest references to the rhyme in English is in the comedy The London Chaunticleres , printed in 1657 , but probably written about 1636 , in which the dairy woman Curds states that she had `` danced the building of London - Bridge '' at the Whitsun Ales in her youth , although no words or actions are mentioned . Widespread familiarity with the rhyme is suggested by its use by Henry Carey in his satire Namby Pamby ( 1725 ) , as : </P> <P> Namby Pamby is no Clown , </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down : Now he courts the gay Ladee Dancing o'er The Lady - Lee . </P> <P> The oldest extant version could be that recalled by a correspondent to the Gentleman 's Magazine in 1823 , which he claimed to have heard from a woman who was a child in the reign of Charles II ( r . 1660 -- 85 ) and had the lyrics : </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down , Dance over the Lady Lea ; London Bridge is broken down , With a gay lady ( la - dee ) . </P> <P> The earliest printed English version is in the oldest extant collection of nursery rhymes , Tommy Thumb 's Pretty Song Book , printed by John Newbery in London ( c. 1744 ) , beginning with the following text : </P> The first page of the rhyme from an 1815 edition of Tommy Thumb 's Pretty Song Book ( c. 1744 ) . James Ritson , whose Gammer Gurton 's Garland contains one of the earliest versions of the rhyme ( Engraving by James Sayers , published in 1803 ) . <P> London Bridge Is Broken down , Dance over my Lady Lee . London Bridge Is Broken down With a gay Lady . </P> <P> A version from James Ritson 's Gammer Gurton 's Garland ( 1784 ) is similar but replaces the last verse with : </P> <P> Build it up with stone so strong , Dance o'er my Lady lee , Huzza ! ' twill last for ages long , With a gay lady . </P> <H2> Meaning ( edit ) </H2> Cnut the Great 's men on the London bridge , under attack by Olaf II of Norway from a Victorian children 's book published in 1894 . <P> The meaning of the rhyme is not certain . It may simply relate to the many difficulties experienced in bridging the River Thames , but a number of alternative theories have been put forward . </P> <H3> Viking attack theory ( edit ) </H3> <P> One theory of origin is that the rhyme relates to the supposed destruction of London Bridge by Olaf II of Norway in 1014 ( or 1009 ) . The nineteenth - century translation of the Norse saga the Heimskringla , published by Samuel Laing in 1844 , included a verse by Óttarr svarti , that looks very similar to the nursery rhyme : </P> <P> London Bridge is broken down . -- Gold is won , and bright renown . Shields resounding , War - horns sounding , Hild is shouting in the din ! Arrows singing , Mail - coats ringing -- Odin makes our Olaf win ! </P> <P> However , modern translations make it clear that Laing was using the nursery rhyme as a model for his very free translation , and the reference to London Bridge does not appear at the start of the verse and it is unlikely that this is an earlier version of the nursery rhyme . Some historians have raised the possibility that the attack never took place . However , the original document detailing the attack was written only about 100 years after what would be a famous event in a highly populated area , leading the majority of historians to conclude that the account is at least relatively accurate . While it might or might not be the origin of the rhyme , this would make King Olaf 's victory the only historically recorded incidence of London Bridge `` falling down . '' </P> <H3> Child sacrifice theory ( edit ) </H3> Detail of the Great Fire of London 1666 by an unknown painter . The Tower of London is on the right and London Bridge on the left . <P> The theory that the song refers to the burying , perhaps alive , of children in the foundations of the bridge was first advanced by Alice Bertha Gomme ( later Lady Gomme ) in The Traditional Games of England , Scotland and Ireland ( 1894 -- 1898 ) and perpetuated by the usually sceptical Iona and Peter Opie . This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice were buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice , who will then watch over the bridge . However , there is no archaeological evidence for any human remains in the foundations of London Bridge . </P> <H3> Age and damage theory ( edit ) </H3> <P> Until the mid-eighteenth century the Old London Bridge was the only crossing on the Thames in London . It was damaged in a major fire in 1633 , but in the fire of 1666 this damage acted as a fire break and prevented the flames from further damaging the bridge and crossing to the south side of the Thames . With its 19 narrow arches , it impeded river traffic and flow . Central piers were removed to create a wider navigational span . Widening and the removal of its houses was completed in 1763 , but it remained relatively narrow and needed continual and expensive repairs . In the early nineteenth century it was decided to replace the bridge with a new construction . New London Bridge was opened in 1831 and survived until it was replaced in 1972 . It was then transported and reconstructed in Lake Havasu City , Arizona . </P> <H3> `` Fair lady '' identity ( edit ) </H3> The seal of Matilda of Scotland , one of the candidates for the `` fair lady '' of the refrain . <P> Several attempts have been made to identify the ' fair lady ' , ' lady gay ' , or lady ' lee / lea ' of the rhyme . They include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Matilda of Scotland ( c. 1080 -- 1118 ) Henry I 's consort , who between 1110 and 1118 was responsible for the building of the series of bridges that carried the London - Colchester road across the River Lea and its side streams between Bow and Stratford . </Li> <Li> Eleanor of Provence ( c. 1223 -- 91 ) , consort of Henry III who had custody of the bridge revenues from 1269 to about 1281 . </Li> <Li> A member of the Leigh family of Stoneleigh Park , Warwickshire , who have a family story that a human sacrifice lies under the building . </Li> <Li> The River Lea , which is a tributary of the Thames . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Legacy and popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <P> Since the late 19th century the rhyme has been seen as one of the most popular and well known in the English - speaking world . It has also been referenced in both literature and popular culture . </P> <Ul> <Li> It was used by T.S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land ( 1922 ) . </Li> <Li> The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration for the title of Lerner and Loewe 's 1956 musical My Fair Lady . </Li> <Li> Chorus of the 1963 Brenda Lee song My Whole World is Falling Down are based on `` London Bridge is Falling Down '' . </Li> <Li> The musical unicorn - in - glass - dome ornament bought by William Foster in the 1993 movie Falling Down plays the tune of the nursery rhyme `` London Bridge is falling down '' . ( So the movie title is evidently derived from this old nursery rhyme . ) </Li> <Li> The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants . </Li> <Li> In 1982 was sampled as `` Halloween Montage '' by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth feat . Tommy Lee Wallace , for the film Halloween III : Season of the Witch , who was used as a song of the Silver Shamrock commercial . </Li> <Li> In The Inbetweeners episode Bunk Off , Simon expresses about losing his virginity to Carli and Jay teases him about the prospect of that - and part of this teasing is riding Simon on Neil 's dad 's sofa and singing about intercourse with Carli to the tune of London Bridge is Falling Down . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Children 's literature portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Dong , Dong , Dongdaemun , a similar Korean nursery rhyme . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : London Bridge Is Falling Down </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to London Bridge Is Falling Down . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : I.

The deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Stan in 2005 , Matthew was the thirteenth named storm , fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season . It caused extensive damage to landmasses in the Greater Antilles , and severe damage in several islands of the Bahamas who were still recovering from Hurricane Joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier . At one point , the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of Category 3 or higher intensity to strike the United States since Hurricane Wilma in 2005 , but Matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the Floridian coastline . </P> <P> Originating from a tropical wave that emerged off Africa on September 22 , Matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the Lesser Antilles on September 28 . It became a hurricane north of Venezuela and Colombia on September 29 , before undergoing explosive intensification , ultimately reaching Category 5 intensity on October 1 at just 13.4 ° N latitude -- the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the Atlantic basin , breaking the record set by Hurricane Ivan in 2004 . Matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the Greater Antilles , remaining a strong Category 4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over Haiti 's Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4 , and then a second one in Cuba later that day . Matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest , making landfall in the northern Bahamas . The storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern United States over the next 36 hours , gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge near Myrtle Beach , South Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane on the morning of October 8 . Matthew re-emerged into the Atlantic shortly afterward , eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from Cape Hatteras , North Carolina on October 9 . </P> <P> Widespread effects were felt from Matthew across its destructive path , however , the most significant impacts were felt in Haiti , with US $1.9 billion in damage and 546 deaths , making Matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake . The combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land ; around 80 % of Jérémie sustained significant damage . Four people were killed in Cuba due to a bridge collapse , and total losses in the country amounted to US $2.58 billion , most of which occurred in the Guantánamo Province . Passing through the Bahamas as a major hurricane , Matthew spread damage across several islands . Grand Bahama was hit directly , where most homes sustained damage in the townships of Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock . Preparations began in earnest across the southeastern United States as Matthew approached , with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties ; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding , especially in the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area . In Florida , over 1 million lost power as the storm passed to the east , with 478,000 losing power in Georgia and South Carolina . While damage was primarily confined to the coast in Florida and Georgia , torrential rains spread inland in the Carolinas and Virginia , causing widespread flooding . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Meteorological history <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Records </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Preparations <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Lesser Antilles and South America </Li> <Li> 2.2 Jamaica </Li> <Li> 2.3 Haiti </Li> <Li> 2.4 Dominican Republic </Li> <Li> 2.5 Cuba and the Bahamas </Li> <Li> 2.6 United States <Ul> <Li> 2.6. 1 Online response </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Impact <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Lesser Antilles </Li> <Li> 3.2 ABC Islands and South America </Li> <Li> 3.3 Jamaica </Li> <Li> 3.4 Haiti </Li> <Li> 3.5 Dominican Republic </Li> <Li> 3.6 Cuba </Li> <Li> 3.7 Bahamas </Li> <Li> 3.8 United States <Ul> <Li> 3.8. 1 Florida and Georgia </Li> <Li> 3.8. 2 North and South Carolina </Li> <Li> 3.8. 3 Virginia and the Northeast </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.9 Canada </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Aftermath <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Lesser Antilles </Li> <Li> 4.2 Haiti </Li> <Li> 4.3 Cuba </Li> <Li> 4.4 United States </Li> <Li> 4.5 Retirement </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Meteorological history ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Meteorological history of Hurricane Matthew Map plotting the track and intensity of the storm , according to the Saffir -- Simpson scale <P> A vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 22 and moved rapidly across the Atlantic , being monitored by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) for possible tropical cyclogenesis . Despite possessing tropical - storm winds as it approached the Lesser Antilles on September 27 , the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone , as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center . However , by 12 : 00 UTC on September 28 , the wave developed a closed circulation while located near Barbados , hence becoming a tropical storm , and was assigned the name Matthew . Continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge , the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18 : 00 UTC on September 29 . The effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day , and Matthew began a period of explosive intensification ; during a 24 - hour period beginning at 00 : 00 UTC on September 30 , the cyclone 's maximum winds more than doubled , from 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) to 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) , making Matthew a Category 5 hurricane , the first since Hurricane Felix in 2007 ; the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the Atlantic since records began . Due to upwelling of cooler waters , Matthew weakened to a Category 4 hurricane later on October 1 , before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) late on October 2 . </P> <P> Slowly rounding the ridge , Matthew fluctuated in intensity within the Category 4 range from October 1 -- 5 . Intensification resumed again late on October 3 and culminated when Matthew made landfall near Les Anglais , Haiti , around 11 : 00 UTC on October 4 with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) and a pressure of 934 millibars ( 27.6 inHg ) , making it the strongest to hit Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964 . Continuing northward , the hurricane struck Maisí in Cuba early on October 5 as a slightly weaker storm . Cuba 's and Haiti 's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category 3 status , as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the Bahamas . Restrengthening occurred as Matthew 's circulation became better organized , with the storm becoming a Category 4 hurricane again while passing Freeport . However , Matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place . The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia , with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in Florida while the system was a Category 3 hurricane ( with the strongest winds remaining just offshore ) . Matthew weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on October 7 and then to a Category 1 hurricane by 12 : 00 UTC on October 8 . </P> The eye of Hurricane Matthew seen from the International Space Station on October 3 . <P> Around 15 : 00 UTC on October 8 , the hurricane made landfall at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge , near McClellanville , South Carolina , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a central pressure of 963 mbar ( 28.4 inHg ) , which made it the strongest to strike the United States in terms of pressure since Hurricane Isaac in 2012 , and the first hurricane to make landfall north of Florida in October since Hurricane Hazel in 1954 . Convection became displaced from the center as Matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear , with the NHC declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200 mi ( 320 km ) east of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , on October 9 . The remnants persisted for another day , before they were absorbed by a cold front . </P> <H3> Records ( edit ) </H3> <P> Matthew set several records during its long and destructive journey . Matthew intensified into a Category 5 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4 degrees north , breaking the record set by Hurricane Ivan in 2004 , which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7 degrees north . Matthew also maintained at least Category 4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of October , according to Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University , doing so for roughly 5 days . </P> <H2> Preparations ( edit ) </H2> Tropical Storm Matthew over the Lesser Antilles , shortly after formation on September 28 <H3> Lesser Antilles and South America ( edit ) </H3> <P> On September 27 , prior to Matthew becoming a tropical cyclone , LIAT began cancelling flights across the Windward Islands in anticipation of squally weather . Schools and businesses were closed for the duration of Matthew 's passage on September 27 and 28 on Grenada , St. Vincent and St. Lucia ; schools in Dominica suspended classes until October 3 . Hewanorra International Airport and George F.L. Charles Airport on St. Lucia were closed on September 28 . Six shelters were opened across the island ; 133 sought refuge in them . Upon the formation of Matthew as a tropical cyclone on September 28 , governments across the Windward Islands issued tropical storm warnings in anticipation of gale - force winds . </P> A map of forecast rainfall totals from Hurricane Matthew for the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas . Peak accumulations in excess of 30 in ( 760 mm ) were expected along the southern coast of Haiti 's Tiburon Peninsula . <P> The storm 's unusual south track prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches on September 28 for Aruba , Bonaire , Curaçao , and the northern coast of Colombia from the Colombia -- Venezuela border to Riohacha . North Atlantic hurricanes affecting South America are uncommon . The watch in Colombia was later upgraded to a warning on September 30 as Matthew continued on a west - southwest track near the country . Residents across the ABC Islands were advised to board their homes and stock up on supplies , leading to long lines at supermarkets and gas stations . Curaçao 's government postponed the 2016 general election until October 5 . Government offices in Aruba closed for September 30 . A local sporting event , the Kingdom Tournament , was canceled in Aruba . Schools across the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia suspended activities for September 30 . Officials opened shelters and closed beaches across the peninsula . </P> <H3> Jamaica ( edit ) </H3> <P> With Matthew posing a significant threat to Jamaica , emergency officials ordered all fishermen on the nation 's cays and banks to evacuate to the mainland on September 29 . The following day , Prime Minister Andrew Holness held an emergency meeting regarding the hurricane and placed the government on high alert . A hurricane watch was issued for the country on September 30 , and later upgraded to a warning on October 1 . Officials in Trelawny Parish placed 60 shelters on stand - by on October 2 . Supermarkets were overwhelmed with residents stocking up on supplies , and many reported empty shelves and low supplies of bread , kerosene , and candles . Many people boarded up their homes and protected their property with sand bags . One hundred female prisoners were relocated from a facility in St. Catherine Parish to another in Kingston . Toll fees along Highway 2000 were to be waived during the hours before Matthew 's arrival . Service at both Norman Manley International Airport and Sangster International Airport was scheduled to be suspended during the evening of October 2 or by the morning of October 3 . The Jamaica Urban Transit Company scheduled to suspend services beginning at 6 : 00 p.m. local time . The Jamaica Public Service informed residents that the power grid might be shut off during the storm if conditions became severe . Members of the Jamaica Defence Force were deployed nationwide in advance of the hurricane in order to more swiftly deal with its aftermath . </P> <P> Schools and government offices suspended operations starting on October 3 . A total of 900 shelters opened across Jamaica and the Urban Transit Company provided buses to evacuate people from Kingston to the National Arena . Local Minister Desmond McKenzie warned that the infrastructure of Kingston would be unable to handle the magnitude of rainfall expected . Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned residents that Matthew could be more severe than Hurricane Gilbert which devastated the nation in 1988 . </P> <H3> Haiti ( edit ) </H3> Play media The animation shows Hurricane Matthew from September 28 to October 2 , and 3 - dimensional radar data from GPM 's DPR instrument . <P> Though forecast to pass over Jamaica at the time , the large extent of tropical storm - force winds prompted the issuance of a tropical storm watch for Haiti 's Tiburon Peninsula toward the border with the Dominican Republic . Following an eastward shift in Matthew 's predicted track , a hurricane watch was issued for much of Haiti on October 1 , encompassing areas from Môle - Saint - Nicolas south to the Dominican Republic border ; this was upgraded to a warning just hours later . The warning eventually encompassed the entire country by the afternoon of October 2 . Residents on outlying islands of Haiti were evacuated to the mainland . Life - threatening rainfall was forecast to affect much of the nation , with accumulations averaging 15 to 25 in ( 38 to 64 cm ) along the southern coast with isolated peaks up to 40 in ( 100 cm ) . Although government officials held meetings on storm preparation , Radio France Internationale reported that Haiti does not have the logistical capability to handle a large - scale disaster . Only 576 shelters , with a collective capacity of 90,000 people , were listed for all of southern Haiti . According to the International Organization for Migration , 55,107 internally displaced persons remained in camps or hosting sites without adequate protection from the hurricane . </P> <P> Provisional President of Haiti Jocelerme Privert addressed the nation on October 2 , urging those living along the coast and in poorly constructed homes to evacuate and comply with authorities . Despite pleas from officials , many residents refused to leave their homes . Schools were closed for October 3 -- 4 , though government offices remained open . Nationwide , a total of 1,300 shelters were readied with a total capacity of 390,000 people . More than 18,000 volunteers and members of the Red Cross , community intervention teams , municipal committees , and local emergency services were readied to assist residents . At least 500 people were evacuated from Jérémie . Although civil protection officials took to the streets to warn people , many residents were unaware that Matthew was even approaching the country a day before its expected landfall . Evacuations continued through the hurricane 's landfall with the total number of people in shelters reaching 9,280 by 2 : 00 a.m. local time on October 4 . </P> <P> On October 5 , the Electoral Provisional Council postponed the presidential election , the second round of the legislative elections and the first round of the Senate elections until November 20 . </P> <H3> Dominican Republic ( edit ) </H3> <P> On the morning of October 2 , a tropical storm warning was raised for the southern coast of the Dominican Republic from Barahona west to the Haitian border , and a tropical storm watch was issued for the northern coast from Puerto Plata west to the Haitian border . At least 8,500 people were evacuated in southwestern areas of the country by the morning of October 3 . </P> <H3> Cuba and the Bahamas ( edit ) </H3> Animation of Hurricane Matthew passing through the Bahamas on October 5 -- 6 <P> The Meteorological Service of Cuba raised hurricane watches for all of southeastern Cuba on October 1 , encompassing the provinces of Camagüey , Las Tunas , Granma , Holguín , Santiago de Cuba , and Guantánamo . This was subsequently upgraded to a warning on October 2 for all provinces except Camagüey . Non-essential personnel in the United States ' Guantanamo Bay Naval Base began evacuations that day . Evacuations of more than 1 million people across Cuba started that morning , including 252,000 in Santiago de Cuba , and 230,000 from Las Tunas with priority placed on those along the coast . Across Santiago de Cuba , which suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 , 218 shelters were opened and officials placed extra attention on Socapa , Caracoles , and Cayo Granma . Emergency personnel , primarily doctors , were dispatched to high - risk areas and supplies were stockpiled . </P> <P> The Government of the Bahamas began issuing hurricane watches on October 2 for southeastern islands as well as the Turks and Caicos . Flights across southern islands were cancelled and schools suspended operations beginning the following day . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> National Hurricane Center Director Richard Knabb ( pictured ) regularly filmed briefings on the forecast and expected impacts of Hurricane Matthew in the United States . <P> On October 3 , the governors of Florida and North Carolina declared a state of emergency . The next day , South Carolina governor Nikki Haley ordered an evacuation for those residents living within one hundred miles ( 160 km ) of the coast . Interstate 26 in South Carolina eastbound between the coast and Columbia was reversed on Wednesday to facilitate movement away from the Lowcountry and Charleston areas . Evacuations of Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina began this day as well . By October 4 , North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory had ordered that evacuation be mandatory . A state of emergency was also declared for 13 counties in eastern Georgia . </P> <P> On October 5 , Port Canaveral was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard , the first closure since 2004 . Eight cruise ships and four cargo ships were scheduled to visit the port between October 5 -- 9 . On Cape Canaveral , home to both civilian and military spaceflight facilities , no rockets or spacecraft were in vulnerable positions ; at the time of Matthew 's approach , the next launch was scheduled for November 4 . The Kennedy Space Center began preparations of the facilities on October 5 . Older buildings at the KSC were designed to withstand winds of 105 -- 125 mph ( 170 -- 200 km / h ) ; buildings constructed after 1992 , when Category 5 Hurricane Andrew struck the Miami area , are built to withstand 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) winds . At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , the U.S. Air Force 's 45th Space Wing began disconnecting electric power to non-essential facilities on October 4 . </P> Hurricane Matthew nearing Florida on October 6 <P> For the fourth time in its 45 - year history , the Walt Disney World Resort closes . Its theme parks are Magic Kingdom , Epcot , Disney 's Hollywood Studios and Disney 's Animal Kingdom water parks are Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon , and Disney Springs were closed at 5 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 6 and did not open on October 7 . This was the first time since 2004 that the parks have closed , all instances due to hurricanes . Other Orlando - area theme parks , including Universal Orlando resort and SeaWorld Orlando , also closed . </P> <P> The Southeastern Conference football matchup between LSU and Florida , scheduled for October 8 in Gainesville , was cancelled . The hurricane washed out NASCAR racing at Charlotte Motor Speedway on October 7 and 8 , with the Drive for the Cure 300 race in the Xfinity Series originally scheduled for October 7 and the Bank of America 500 race in the Sprint Cup Series originally scheduled for October 8 both postponed until October 9 . </P> <P> On October 6 , U.S. President Barack Obama declared a federal state of emergency for Florida , later extending to include Georgia and South Carolina . Florida 's governor Rick Scott urged over 1.5 million people to evacuate , with Hurricane Matthew expected to make landfall by the evening of that day . Several news anchors also issued dire warnings urging Floridians to evacuate . </P> <P> That same day , Georgia governor Nathan Deal ordered a mandatory evacuation for all areas of the state east of Interstate 95 , and the Georgia Department of Public Safety reversed the eastbound lanes on a portion of Interstate 16 effective until the following day . </P> Online Response ( edit ) <P> On October 6 , the conservative news aggregator Drudge Report -- run by Matt Drudge -- headlined a five - word comment on Matthew : `` Storm Fizzle ? Matthew Looks Ragged ! '' which linked to a Miami Herald article . Drudge later used Twitter to claim that the National Hurricane Center was lying to the public about the intensity of the storm , stating that measurements from Nassau , Bahamas , did not match the 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) gusts listed in public advisories . The tweets implied that the hurricane was not as dangerous as it seemed and that politicians were trying to `` blame mankind , '' referring to a blog posting about Hillary Clinton . This came on the heels of radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh 's claims of the conspiracy to `` sell '' climate change . The claims of conspiracy were posted as Matthew posed a dire threat to Florida 's east coast and when residents across the state were being urged to evacuate immediately . Drudge 's commentary was quickly met with sharp condemnation and criticism from meteorologists and public officials . Democratic Representative Keith Ellison called the comments `` irresponsible '' and urged people to `` not listen to this man . '' Jason Samenow of The Washington Post described it as an `` incredible and offensive accusation '' , and stated that it `` may have introduced enough doubt to lead ( residents ) into a decision they will regret .

One person was killed in the town of Layou when a boulder broke loose and crushed him . In nearby Buccament Bay , a river overtopped its banks , prompting at least 25 people to evacuate to emergency shelters . The Hermitage River rose by at least 3.6 ft ( 1.1 m ) in one hour , and as a precautionary measure , the Central Water and Sewage Authority shut off all water service . Flooding also took place in Vermont , South Rivers , sections of Kingstown , Campden Park , Arnos Vale , and Langley Park . Debris deposited by flooded rivers rendered many roads impassable . </P> <P> Strong winds in excess of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) downed many trees and power lines on St. Lucia , leaving roughly 70 percent of the island without power . Landslides and flooding , the result of more than 10 in ( 250 mm ) of rain accompanying the storm , damaged many homes and roads . Rainfall at Hewanorra International Airport amounted to 13.19 in ( 335 mm ) . The nation 's banana crop suffered significant damage ; 85 percent of farms reported losses . Two homes were destroyed , one in Bisee , and one in Gros Islet ; several others were damaged . Roads in Castries , Gros - Islet , Dennery , and Soufriere became impassible from debris or landslides . Some damage was also reported on Dominica , temporarily leaving many people without water and electricity . Heavy rainfall in Grenada disrupted the water supply in multiple communities . </P> <P> In Martinique strong winds , which gusted up to 89 mph ( 143 km / h ) in Saint - Pierre , wreaked havoc on the power grid ; roughly 55,000 people lost electricity . Numerous trees downed by the winds blocked roadways while heavy rains led to flooding . The main road from Fort - de-France to southern towns was rendered impassable during the storm . Approximately 4,000 people lost their water supply . Three people sustained minor injuries . </P> <H3> ABC Islands and South America ( edit ) </H3> <P> The effects of Matthew across the ABC Islands were relatively limited despite its proximity . Some street flooding occurred on Aruba and Curaçao . Heavy winds were also experienced . There was some damage to cars after street flooding occurred . Outdoor bars and restaurants were damaged . The Guajira Peninsula of Colombia saw its first heavy rain event in three years , leading to widespread flash flooding . One person drowned in a swollen river in Uribia ; 1.29 in ( 32.8 mm ) of rain fell in 30 minutes in the town . Rainfall in Cartagena reached 8.7 in ( 222 mm ) during a 24 - hour span and Santa Marta saw 5.5 in ( 140 mm ) . Along coastal areas of the peninsula , large swells damaged buildings , prompting the evacuation of 380 people in Manaure . Roughly 70 percent of Tucurinca flooded when the Magdalena River overtopped its banks ; a nearby bridge collapsed , isolating some communities . Approximately 73,000 people were affected by the floods . The dangerous conditions produced by Matthew prevented thousands of people from voting in a peace agreement referendum . </P> <H3> Jamaica ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

Along the coast , rip currents and beach erosion was reported , with additional flooding due to rainfall occurring . Strong wind gusts tore at the island 's vegetation , causing minor damage . </P> <H3> Haiti ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Effects of Hurricane Matthew in Haiti Hurricane Matthew approaching Jamaica , Haiti and Cuba on October 3 <P> Large swells reached the outlying Haitian island of Île - à - Vache on October 2 , prompting the evacuation of 89 people . Despite boating bans , many fishermen continued work in rough conditions . Consequently , two fishermen went missing on the morning of October 3 : one near Saint - Jean - du - Sud and the other near Aquin ; one was later found dead . Antecedent rainfall associated with the outer bands of Matthew triggered flooding in several towns in southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic . A person was killed when a tree fell on his home in Port Salut , while a 26 - year - old man drowned while trying to rescue a child from a rushing river . </P> <P> Striking the Tiburon Peninsula as a Category 4 hurricane on the morning of October 4 , Matthew was the strongest storm to directly impact Haiti since Hurricane Cleo in 1964 . An anemometer at Antoine - Simon Airport in Les Cayes , east of where Matthew made landfall , measured a gust of 107 mph ( 172 km / h ) before the station went offline . Gusts in the nation 's capital city of Port - au - Prince reached 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . Communications with areas in the direct path of Matthew were lost , and tens of thousands of people became isolated as roads and bridges were destroyed . A major bridge connecting parts of Grand'Anse to the rest of the country collapsed during a flash flood . 80 % of Jérémie , along the north shore of the Tiburon Peninsula , suffered tremendous damage ; homes were flattened and medical facilities suffered major damage . A radio host in Port - au - Prince stated that Jérémie was `` pretty much wiped out from the seaboard all the way to the cathedral '' . </P> <P> Officially , 546 deaths were attributed to the storm in Haiti , however local governments believed the death toll to be over 1,000 ; this value may have been overestimated . According to the nation 's Civil Protection Directorate , the death toll was 546 as of October 14 , with 128 people missing and 439 injured . This figure was later confirmed by the National Hurricane Center . The government also estimates damages at close to $1.9 billion . Approximately 2.1 million people were affected by the storm , of whom 1.4 million ( 12 percent of Haiti 's population ) were left in need of assistance . Furthermore , roughly 175,000 people were left homeless . </P> <H3> Dominican Republic ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Dominican Republic reported significant rainfall and coastal flooding due to Matthew , an automated weather station in Cabo Rojo , Dominican Republic , measured 8.43 in ( 214 mm ) of rain by the afternoon of October 3 .

Hurricane Matthew struck the easternmost province of Cuba during the evening of October 4 as a Category 4 , causing tremendous damage . The coastal city of Baracoa suffered widespread damage from violent winds , and storm surge , the latter of which gutted countless buildings . Despite the severity of damage , no fatalities were reported in the city . A communication tower in Majayara collapsed during the storm and a bridge spanning the Toa river was destroyed ; several communities left isolated as a result . Damages in Cuba amounted to $2.58 billion USD ; most of which occurred in the Guantánamo Province . </P> <P> Nearly two months later , on November 22 , a municipal bridge in the city of Moa that was damaged by Hurricane Matthew collapsed , killing four employees of Canadian mining company Sherritt International . The employees were undertaking repairs to restore access between Moa and a mining site . </P> <H3> Bahamas ( edit ) </H3> <P> Experiencing a direct hit from the eyewall of Matthew , Grand Bahama suffered extensive damage . An estimated 95 percent of homes in Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock sustained severe damage . Numerous trees and power lines were toppled by the storm 's high winds , rendering roads impassable . Flooding - induced by the backside of the storm affected much of the western half of the island . Total losses from Matthew in the Bahamas are estimated to be around $600 million USD . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> <Table> Deaths and damage by U.S. state <Tr> <Th> State </Th> <Th> Deaths </Th> <Th> Damage </Th> <Th> Ref </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Florida </Td> <Td> 12 </Td> <Td> $2.75 billion </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Georgia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> > $90 million </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> North Carolina </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> <Td> $1.6 billion </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> South Carolina </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> $249.6 million </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Virginia </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> $58.14 million </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In total , the storm killed 47 people in the US , including 26 in North Carolina , 12 in Florida , 3 in Georgia , 4 in South Carolina , and 2 in Virginia . According to the National Centers for Environmental Information , damage from Matthew across the United States reached approximately $10 billion . This ranked it the costliest national disaster in the country for 2016 alongside record floods in Louisiana . </P> Florida and Georgia ( edit ) <P> As Hurricane Matthew traveled rapidly towards the southeastern region of the United States , it hit closely to the coasts of Florida , South Carolina , Georgia , and North Carolina . On October 7 in Fernandina Beach , Florida , there was a peak surge of 9.88 ft ( 3.01 m ) above normal . Additionally , in the St. Augustine area , water was reported to be 2.5 ft ( 0.76 m ) above ground . </P> <P> As Matthew tracked parallel to the Florida coast , it left over one million people without power across the state of Florida . In Jacksonville it caused major sand dune damage and flooding in the St. Johns River . It also destroyed many properties and knocked out power for nearly 250,000 electrical customers . In Indialantic , Florida , firefighters exposed themselves to the storm 's winds to put out a fire , which reportedly destroyed a greenhouse . In Florida , one woman died due to a heart attack ; she had called for aid , but medical services were not able to arrive due to Matthew 's high winds . Another two women were killed by falling trees . In the Flagler Beach area , a portion of Florida State Road A1A was washed away . At Kennedy Space Center , winds reached 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) at ground level while a gust of 136 mph ( 219 km / h ) was observed atop a 500 ft ( 150 m ) tower . The facility suffered several million dollars - worth of damage , though overall impacts were less than anticipated . The roof of Operations Support Building II broke , and rainwater damaged the interior . Air conditioning was lost throughout Launch Complex 39 as well . The planned launches of GOES - R , NOAA 's next generation weather satellite , and CYGNSS , a cluster of smaller satellites which study hurricanes , were delayed due to the suspension of operations during Matthew . </P> <P> Over 250,000 customers were left without power in Georgia after Hurricane Matthew affected the area . Roads were also blocked in the Brunswick , Georgia , area , where all access points to St. Simons Island were rendered impassable . </P> North and South Carolina ( edit ) Flooding in Charleston , South Carolina on October 8 . <P> Across South Carolina , at least 600,000 individuals lost power , where significant flooding was reported to have occurred in Charleston after a seawall was breached . Hilton Head Island experienced widespread water , sewer and power outages for several days , and the only road onto the island was not re-opened to residents until October 11 . It is estimated that over 120,000 trees were downed on the island , causing extensive tree - strike damage to residences and businesses . Over 2.1 million cubic yards of vegetative debris generated by the storm was collected . The Waccamaw River crested in Conway at 17.9 ft ( 5.5 m ) , breaking a record set by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . The Little Pee Dee River reached a record crest of 17.1 ft ( 5.2 m ) at Galivant 's Ferry , also breaking a 1928 record . </P> The Tar River overflowing its banks near Pitt -- Greenville Airport on October 12 ; it later crested at 24.5 feet ( 7.5 m ) . <P> Twenty - six people died in storm - related incidents across North Carolina . 680,000 in North Carolina were without power at one point . Sections of Interstate 95 in South Carolina and in North Carolina had to be shut down as a result of hurricane flooding . The North Carolina section reopened October 17 . After 10 in ( 25 cm ) of rain fell in Cumberland , Harnett , Hoke , Moore and Robeson Counties on September 28 causing flooding , Matthew dumped another 10 in ( 25 cm ) to 14 in ( 36 cm ) . As a result , the Lumber River reached a record 24 ft ( 7.3 m ) in the south end of Lumberton , breaking the record of 20.5 ft ( 6.2 m ) feet . Robeson County schools did not reopen until October 31 . In Smithfield , the Neuse River crested at 29.09 ft ( 8.87 m ) , 2 ft ( 0.61 m ) higher than after Hurricane Fran . In Kinston , the Neuse crested at 28.31 ft ( 8.63 m ) , a foot ( 300 mm ) higher than the record set by Hurricane Floyd . In Greenville , the Tar River crested at 24.5 ft ( 7.5 m ) . Preliminary estimates indicate that roughly 100,000 structures were flooded across the state and damage reached US $1.5 billion . </P> Virginia and the Northeast ( edit ) Heavy rains and high winds resulted in trees falling and record flooding in Lago Mar , Virginia Beach , Virginia . <P> When the hurricane hit Virginia , Matthew caused two deaths and street flooding in the eastern part of the state . The Northeast received heavy rain and minor flooding throughout the days of October 9 and 10 . </P> <H3> Canada ( edit ) </H3> Satellite image loop from October 6 , when Matthew was a hurricane , to October 11 , when it had joined a mid-latitude storm sweeping across eastern Canada . <P> Matthew 's post-tropical remains were absorbed into a frontal zone off the coast of North Carolina . The humidity of the tropical system was drawn into the storm that was formed then . The latter gave heavy rain and strong winds in Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland from October 10 to 11 . </P> <P> In Nova Scotia , rain amounts were recorded from east to west as 8.85 in ( 224.8 mm ) in Sydney ( Cape Breton Island ) , 5.09 in ( 129.2 mm ) in Port Hawkesbury , 4.50 in ( 114.4 mm ) in Chéticamp , 4.05 in ( 102.8 mm ) in Halifax , 3.263 in ( 82.88 mm ) in Kentville , and 1.94 in ( 49.2 mm ) in Yarmouth . Heavy rains and strong winds caused flooding and dangerous conditions , particularly in the counties of Pictou , Antigonish , Guysborough and Cape Breton . Several roads were closed to heavy trucks , including Halifax Harbour bridges and the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island . </P> <P> Newfoundland was even more affected with accumulations generally ranging from 3.9 to 5.9 in ( 100 to 150 mm ) in the central , southern and western areas . Steady rain fell sometimes at a rate of 0.39 to 0.79 in ( 10 to 20 mm ) per hour , and even 1.7 in ( 42 mm ) per hour in Burgeo . A private station in that community recorded a total of 9.23 in ( 234.4 mm ) , while the official station of the Gander International Airport signaled 6.45 in ( 163.8 mm ) . </P> <P> The rain caused numerous landslides and swollen rivers cut roads . The state of emergency was declared in Lewisporte , St. Alban 's and Little Burnt Bay . The town of St. Alban 's , a community of about 1,200 , was cut off from the surrounding communities when the main bridge in town was carried by the waters and a nearby community ( Conne River ) provided a boat to transport people to St. Alban 's and out of the community . The highway to Burgeo , on the south coast of Newfoundland , was also flooded and had to be closed . </P> <P> The winds of over 56 mph ( 90 km / h ) also caused many fallen trees and electric power outages . The official maximum winds were recorded in Port aux Basques at 80 mph ( 128 km / h ) and informally in Green Island , Fortune Bay , at 81 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Damage to roads across Newfoundland was assessed in excess of CA $10 million ( US $7.6 million ) . </P> <H2> Aftermath ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Lesser Antilles ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Martinique , Électricité de France requested additional crews from Guadeloupe and French Guiana to help restore power . Members of the military and Forces françaises aux Antilles were deployed to assist in clearing debris from roadways . The St. Lucia Red Cross distributed non-food items to 270 people affected by the storm . </P> <H3> Haiti ( edit ) </H3> A CH - 53E Sea Stallion helicopter assigned to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit , lands on the flight deck of the amphibious transport dock ship USS Mesa Verde . It is underway in preparation to support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts in Haiti in response to Hurricane Matthew <P> On October 4 , the United States prepared the aircraft carrier , the hospital ship USNS Comfort -- which previously aided thousands in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake -- and the transport dock for relief operations in Haiti . USS Mesa Verde and USS George Washington were later relieved by USS Iwo Jima , along with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit . United States Southern Command also deployed 100 troops with 9 helicopters to the Cayman Islands to prepare for relief work . Initial estimates indicated at least 350,000 people were in need of assistance . </P> <P> The bridge between the south and Port - au - Prince was destroyed . As a result , aid agencies reported they were having difficulty getting around to the most damaged and storm - affected parts of Haiti . </P> <P> The commander of U.S. forces in the Caribbean reported that troops and 6 helicopters from Joint Task Force - Bravo had been deployed to Haiti for the aftermath , and were expected to arrive on October 6 . These are expected to help with search - and - rescue missions as well as providing medical assistance . In addition to his , a one - star navy admiral will also travel to lead the task force involved in the operations . More than 300 military personnel will most likely travel to Haiti , with 300 Marines on board on the ships sent out for aid from the U.S. </P> <P> A number of aid agencies deployed to Haiti to help with the aftermath : </P> <Ul> <Li> Action Aid reported that over 50,000 people were in immediate need of clean water and shelters . </Li> <Li> World Nation also sent out helicopters , reporting difficulties and their concern about young children and food . They will be providing water and sanitation for over 50,000 people . </Li> <Li> The UN 's World Food Program arranged for enough food to feed up to 300,000 people for a month . A further 34 tonnes are ready in Miami to be used if needed . </Li> <Li> UNICEF will be providing life - saving aid for 10,000 people . </Li> <Li> UN 's Food and Agricultural Organisation said it would be helping farmers rebuild their businesses by providing seeds . </Li> <Li> The US Agency for International Development said it would provide $400,000 for aid to Jamaica and Haiti on October 3 . </Li> <Li> Red Cross launched a campaign to raise $9.6 million to provide water , shelter , and food for 50,000 people . They also sent a large number of local volunteers to the south . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Cuba ( edit ) </H3> <P> The World Food Programme coordinated with the Government of Cuba to provide food to approximately 180,000 people in need across eastern provinces . The operation would span six months and cost US $4 million . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> North Carolina National Guard assisting with high - water rescues in Fayetteville , North Carolina <P> In Georgia , the Governor retracted previous evacuations later , emphasizing that their lives could not be endangered for those who chose not to leave . 1,000 members of the National Guard were deployed for help later . </P> <P> In North Carolina , nearly 900 people had been rescued by boat crews by the morning of October 9 .

SkyClan , the long - forgotten fifth Clan of the forest , is later introduced in the stand - alone novel Firestar 's Quest . It receives additional focus in the novel SkyClan 's Destiny , the manga trilogy SkyClan and the Stranger , and the 2013 novella Cloudstar 's Journey . </P> <P> There are currently six sub-series , each containing six books .

The series has also been translated into several languages . In addition , the series has a website featuring games , promotional videos , quizzes , and news . The official message boards closed on August 12 , 2016 . </P> <P> Major themes in the series deal with adventure , forbidden love , the concept of nature vs. nurture , the reactions of different faiths meeting each other , and characters being a mix of good and bad . The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien , J.K. Rowling , and William Shakespeare . </P> <P> Warriors have received mostly positive reviews , but it has also been criticised for being confusing due to its large number of characters . Critics have compared it to the Redwall series , though one reviewer commented that the series is less elegantly written . Although nominated for several awards , Warriors has yet to receive any major literary prizes . The series has reached the New York Times Bestseller List and has found popularity in many countries , including Trinidad , Germany and China . </P> <P> On October 20 , 2016 , Vicky Holmes and Kate Cary , two of the Erin Hunters , announced that Alibaba Pictures had acquired the film rights to the series . The release date is undetermined as recent financial troubles with Alibaba may cause the film to be delayed . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Setting </Li> <Li> 2 The Clans <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Hierarchy </Li> <Li> 2.2 Terminology </Li> <Li> 2.3 The Warrior Code </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Warriors : The Prophecies Begin </Li> <Li> 4 Warriors : The New Prophecy </Li> <Li> 5 Warriors : Power of Three </Li> <Li> 6 Warriors : Omen of the Stars </Li> <Li> 7 Warriors : Dawn of the Clans </Li> <Li> 8 Warriors : A Vision of Shadows </Li> <Li> 9 Other books <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Super Editions <Ul> <Li> 9.1. 1 Firestar 's Quest </Li> <Li> 9.1. 2 Bluestar 's Prophecy </Li> <Li> 9.1. 3 SkyClan 's Destiny </Li> <Li> 9.1. 4 Crookedstar 's Promise </Li> <Li> 9.1. 5 Yellowfang 's Secret </Li> <Li> 9.1. 6 Tallstar 's Revenge </Li> <Li> 9.1. 7 Bramblestar 's Storm </Li> <Li> 9.1. 8 Moth Flight 's Vision </Li> <Li> 9.1. 9 Hawkwing 's Journey </Li> <Li> 9.1. 10 Tigerheart 's Shadow </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.2 Field guides <Ul> <Li> 9.2. 1 Warriors : The Ultimate Guide </Li> <Li> 9.2. 2 Warriors : Cats of the Clans </Li> <Li> 9.2. 3 Warriors : Battles of the Clans </Li> <Li> 9.2. 4 Warriors : Code of the Clans </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.3 Original English - language manga <Ul> <Li> 9.3. 1 Graystripe 's trilogy </Li> <Li> 9.3. 2 The Rise of Scourge </Li> <Li> 9.3. 3 Tigerstar and Sasha <Ul> <Li> 9.3. 3.1 Into the Woods </Li> <Li> 9.3. 3.2 Escape from the Forest </Li> <Li> 9.3. 3.3 Return to the Clans </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.3. 4 Ravenpaw 's Path </Li> <Li> 9.3. 5 SkyClan and the Stranger </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.4 Novellas <Ul> <Li> 9.4. 1 Hollyleaf 's Story </Li> <Li> 9.4. 2 Mistystar 's Omen </Li> <Li> 9.4. 3 Cloudstar 's Journey </Li> <Li> 9.4. 4 Tigerclaw 's Fury </Li> <Li> 9.4. 5 Leafpool 's Wish </Li> <Li> 9.4. 6 Dovewing 's Silence </Li> <Li> 9.4. 7 Mapleshade 's Vengeance </Li> <Li> 9.4. 8 Goosefeather 's Curse </Li> <Li> 9.4. 9 Ravenpaw 's Farewell </Li> <Li> 9.4. 10 Spottedleaf 's Heart </Li> <Li> 9.4. 11 Pinestar 's Choice </Li> <Li> 9.4. 12 Thunderstar 's Echo </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Chronological Timeline </Li> <Li> 11 Inspiration and origins </Li> <Li> 12 Critical reception <Ul> <Li> 12.1 Awards and recognitions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 13 Themes </Li> <Li> 14 Editions <Ul> <Li> 14.1 Foreign editions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 15 Other media <Ul> <Li> 15.1 Website </Li> <Li> 15.2 Film </Li> <Li> 15.3 Short stories </Li> <Li> 15.4 Plays </Li> <Li> 15.5 Mobile application </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 16 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Setting ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of Warriors characters <P> In the Warriors universe , a large group of feral cats has settled into a forest , and claimed it for their own . The cats are split into four smaller Clans : ThunderClan lives in woodland areas , WindClan reside on the moors , RiverClan by the lake and ShadowClan within and around the swamps . A fifth Clan , SkyClan , also used to be a part of this system , but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed to make human houses . Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain ; RiverClan , for example , will swim in the river to catch fish , whilst the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water . </P> <P> Although they all share the forest , relationships between different Clans are tense . They often come into conflict with one another , becoming aggressive if a cat from a neighboring Clan accidentally crosses a border . This rivalry can increase in times of deprivation , such as if one Clan is suffering from a shortage of prey but another is thriving . An attempt for one Clan to steal all of part of another Clan 's territory is not unusual . To prepare for this , cats in all Clans are taught battle moves in order to protect their territory . Each Clan has signature battle moves that are taught to them from an early age ( 6 months / moons old ) . Border fights are the most common source of battle ( a cat intentionally or unwittingly steps into another Clan 's territory ) , and are often short - lived and cause no real damage to either side . However , bigger and more brutal battles can occur ; at this point , casualties are to be expected . Despite this rivalry , the Clans can also show concern for another 's well being ; the idea of one Clan being destroyed causes deep distress , and will prompt urgent action on behalf of all four Clans . On the night of every full moon , the Clans will meet at a designated spot in order to share stories and news in peace . This is known as a ' Gathering ' , and is the only time in which fighting is prohibited . </P> <P> Cats who live outside of the Clans are split into three groups . Housecats , known as ' kittypets ' , are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life . Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore ; at this point , they are chased away , but will rarely come to harm . As a result , kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest . ' Loners ' are cats who walk outside of the Clans , usually by themselves . Although regarded by the Clans with suspicion , they do not cause the forest cats any trouble , and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace . Similar to loners are ' rogues ' , who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm . It is not unusual for a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge . For a kittypet , loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare , but not unheard of . Often , these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust by the rest of the community . </P> <P> Beyond the Clans ' territories lies a mountain range , inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water . The Tribe is shown to be similar to the Clans , yet follows a different set of ancestors : the Tribe of Endless Hunting . The Tribe has a Healer , cave - guards , and prey - hunters , who each serve a different function in the Tribe . The Healer leads the Tribe , heals the ill and wounded , and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting ; the cave - guards defend the Tribe , and the prey - hunters hunt. The Tribe was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains . In turn , cats from the Tribe moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans . </P> <P> StarClan is a group of the Clans ' deceased ancestors who give guidance to the Clans . After death , most Clan cats join StarClan . StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt ( Graystripe 's mate ) , and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior . Upon joining StarClan , the cats ' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living ( i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured ). StarClan Warriors , elders , deputies , queens , and kits keep watch over the Clans , usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive . They provide guidance to the Clans , often through dreams and other signs like omens . Often , this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone , a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine , which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine and leader cats ' ancestors every half - moon . This is later replaced by the Moonpool , a small body of water from which cats can drink from in order to communicate with StarClan . In an author chat , Hunter said that StarClan can `` just get glimpses of '' the future , which they occasionally pass on , although these visions tend to be convoluted and difficult to understand . StarClan cats are often described as being transparent and silver in color , with stars sparkling around their paws . In the manga , their eyes are portrayed as blank and empty . On very rare occasions , a StarClan cat will interact with the world of the living , mainly to take a recently deceased cat to their place of resting . When a StarClan cat is forgotten by all living memory , or is killed in battle , they will fade away - it is unknown what happens to them after this . </P> <P> In addition to StarClan , there exists the Dark Forest , also known as The Place of No Stars . The spirits of cats who cause great pain and suffering to others during their lives reside there in order to pay for their sins . As the name suggests , it takes the form of a never - ending forest , forcing its residents to forever walk alone . Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment , they later learn how to walk in the dreams of living cats . Like StarClan cats , Dark Forest residents will fade away if they are forgotten , or killed in battle . A unique aspect is that if a living cat dies whilst visiting the Dark Forest in their dreams , they will automatically become a spirit of the Dark Forest themselves . In addition , it is possible for StarClan cats to become lost within the forest if they stay there for too long , hence why the majority avoid it . </P> <H2> The Clans ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Hierarchy ( edit ) </H3> <P> Each Clan has an identical hierarchical system . From birth , newborn kittens are known as ' kits ' , as evidenced by the ' - kit ' suffix at the end of their name . Parents of the kits choose the names ; often , a name is related to their appearance ( ' Greykit ' ) , an element of nature ( ' Sandkit ' ) , or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born ( ' Brokenkit ' ) . Mothers , known as ' queens ' , then look after their kits for their first six months of life . Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times , and sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ' nursery ' . </P> <P> Once a kit has reached six moons old , they become ' apprentices ' . As a mark of this , each kit is now given the suffix ' paw ' . For example , ' Greykit ' would become ' Greypaw ' . An apprentice is then assigned to a ' mentor ' . Mentors are often carefully chosen in order to fulfill an apprentice 's full potential ; for example , a rather highly - strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor , whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery . It is the job of a mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation , teaching them to hunt , fight , and patrol borders . Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den . In addition to training , apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean . </P> <P> After six moons of training , apprentices are given a final assessment to judge how far they have improved . If they pass , they are then made warriors . Another naming ceremony is held , this time to mark the cat as being a full member of the Clan . Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance ; for example , ' Greystripe ' would be named after the grey stripe running down his back , ' Brokentail ' after the kink in his tail , and ' Sandstorm ' after her fiery personality . It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the same name . Once named , warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan , while the rest of the clan is sleeping . After the vigil , warriors are free to move into the warrior 's den , where the majority of the Clan sleeps . The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs . They are able to hunt by themselves , and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle . Warriors can take a mate , and females can give birth to new kits ; if this occurs , the expecting mother , known as a ' queen ' , will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices . The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices . Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life , or until they are old enough to retire . </P> <P> If a cat so chooses , they can take a different calling in life as that of a medicine cat . Medicine cats , unlike warriors , serve for their clan not through bloodshed , but through peace . They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines ; for example , cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds , whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep . They sleep separately , surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy . Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors , due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember . Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits . This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally ; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual , they may unfairly place that cat 's life over that of the Clan . A Clan tends to have only one or two , and occasionally three , medicine cats at any given time . </P> <P> When a warrior is so old , or sustains an injury that means they can no longer serve their Clan , they retire to become elders . Elders live out the remainder of their life in general peace , using it as a time of rest and relaxation . They sleep in their own separate den , which is looked after by the apprentices . Elders are not expected to hunt or fight for their Clan , but are able to do so if the mood takes them . Their only expected duty is to carry the body of a deceased Clanmate to their grave . Every cat of the Clan respects and appreciates the elders , thanking them for the time they have spent upholding their roles as a warrior . Sadly , it is rare for a Clan to have more than three or four elders , as many warriors die before they can retire . </P> <P> The most important role in the Clan is that of the leader . The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life , and will make all the important decisions , such as whether or not to engage in battle . Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan , in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan , and to serve their clans for many more moons to come . This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat . To mark their new status , Clan leaders are given the suffix -- star ( e.g. Bluestar , Tallstar , and Brokenstar ) . Generally , Clan leaders sleep alone , although male leaders are allowed to take a mate . Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits , which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series . </P> <P> Another crucial role in the Clan is that of the deputy . When a new Clan leader is appointed , or the old deputy dies or retires , a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role . The deputy of a Clan is generally in charge of less urgent , but still important duties , such as deciding which cats will go on a hunting patrol and which will check the borders . Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den , they are respected by other members of the Clan . Often , a cat will come to the deputy first when asking for advice . When a Clan leader dies , the current deputy will take on the new role of leader , and receive their nine lives from StarClan . </P> <H3> Terminology ( edit ) </H3> <P> Unlike other animal stories that uses words humans use , the feline characters of the Warriors series use different words for certain concepts and objects in the natural world . The most common terms found within the books are ' Twolegs ' ( humans ) , ' kittypets ' ( house cats ) , ' monsters ' ( cars ) , ' the Thunderpath ' ( a road ) or ' the horseplace ' ( a stable ) . The cats also have their own terms for time and measurement , such as sundown or moonhigh representing different times of day according to the positions of the moon , sun , and stars overhead . The seasons are given names according to the trees and foliage in the forest , with ' newleaf ' meaning spring , ' greenleaf ' meaning summer , ' leaf - fall ' meaning autumn , and ' leaf - bare ' meaning winter . </P> <H3> The warrior code ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Warrior Cat world consists of a series of laws that the warriors call `` The Warrior Code . '' All Warriors must follow this code , and will be punished if a warrior strays too far from the code . An example of this is when Firestar , ( then Firepaw ) helped warriors outside of his clan . The guide book Code of the Clans explains how each law of the code originated . ThunderClan , RiverClan , WindClan , ShadowClan , and SkyClan all took part of building and revising the code . He had to take care of Yellowfang , a rouge that originated from ShadowClan . Kits are taught the Warrior code as early as possible . The official code is as follows : </P> <Ol> <Li> Defend your clan , even with your life . You may have friendships with cats from other clans , but your loyalties must remain to your Clan , as one day you may meet them in battle . </Li> <Li> Do not hunt or trespass on another Clan 's territory </Li> <Li> Elders , queens , and kits must be fed before apprentices and warriors . Unless they have permission , apprentices may not eat until they have hunted to feed the elders . If any warrior or apprentice is sick or injured , they may eat while the elders , queens , and kits are eating . </Li> <Li> Prey is only to be eaten . Give thanks to StarClan for its life . </Li> <Li> A kit must be at least 6 moons old to become an apprentice . </Li> <Li> Newly appointed warriors will keep a silent vigil for one night after receiving their warrior name . </Li> <Li> A cat can not be made deputy without having mentored at least one apprentice . </Li> <Li> The deputy will become Clan leader when the leader dies , retires or is exiled . </Li> <Li> After the death or retirement of the deputy , the new deputy must be chosen before moonhigh . </Li> <Li> A Gathering of all four Clans is held at the full moon during a truce that lasts for the night . There shall be no fighting among Clans at this time . </Li> <Li> Boundaries must be checked and marked daily . Challenge all trespassing cats . </Li> <Li> No warrior can neglect a kit in pain or danger , even if the kit is from a different Clan . </Li> <Li> The word of the Clan leader is the warrior code . </Li> <Li> An honorable warrior does not need to kill other cats to win their battles , unless they are outside the warrior code or if it is necessary for self - defense . </Li> <Li> A warrior rejects the soft life of a kittypet . </Li> </Ol> <P> Apart from the official code , another rule states that Medicine Cats can not have mates or kits . Leafpool , a ThunderClan medicine cat breaks this rule when she goes off with Crowfeather , a WindClan warrior . </P> <H2> Warriors : the Prophecies Begin ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Warriors ( arc ) <P> The original Warriors series , later re-titled Warriors : The Prophecies Begin , was released from 2003 to 2004 and consists of six books : Into the Wild ( January 21 , 2003 ) , Fire and Ice ( May 27 , 2003 ) , Forest of Secrets ( October 14 , 2003 ) , Rising Storm ( January 6 , 2004 ) , A Dangerous Path ( June 1 , 2004 ) , and The Darkest Hour ( 5 October 2004 ) .

Scourge then decides to take over the forest for himself , leaving all four Clans to join together and fight for their survival . Firestar loses the first of his one million lives in battle against Scourge , but kills Scourge when he returns to life , defeating BloodClan and saving the forest . </P> <H2> Warriors : the new Prophecy ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Warriors : The New Prophecy <P> The second series , Warriors : The New Prophecy , was released from 2005 to 2006 , and consists of six books : Midnight ( May 10 , 2005 ) , Moonrise ( August 1 , 2005 ) , Dawn ( December 27 , 2005 ) , Starlight ( April 4 , 2006 ) , Twilight ( August 22 , 2006 ) , and Sunset ( December 26 , 2006 ) . </P> <P> In this series , the Clan 's survival is put at risk as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery .

The novel then returns to when Bluestar was still a kit , Bluekit . Bluekit is apprenticed to Stonepelt as Bluepaw , and proves to be an excellent hunter , catching a squirrel `` almost as big as her '' on her first day of hunting . The next day , Goosefeather sees a sign in the vole Snowpaw ( Bluepaw 's sister ) brings back to camp and proclaims that ThunderClan must attack WindClan . Later , he tells them that they must destroy WindClan 's medicine supply in order to keep them at bay during winter . Pinestar is reluctant but agrees to attack at dawn . Bluepaw and Snowpaw are ordered to stay out of the fight , but they help Featherwhisker , the medicine cat apprentice , tend to the wounded . During the battle , Bluepaw 's mother , Moonflower , destroys WindClan 's medicine supplies , but is killed by Hawkheart , the WindClan medicine cat . Bluepaw enters a state of grief which lasts until Sunfall , the deputy and her new mentor since Stonepelt was injured during the WindClan battle and never healed , talks her out of it , telling her that she must honor Moonflower by doing well . She attends the Gathering that night , where she meets and becomes friendly with Crookedpaw and Oakheart of RiverClan . </P> <P> A while later , Bluepaw receives her warrior name , Bluefur , and Snowpaw receives hers , Snowfur . Bluefur finds out that a Clanmate , Thrushpelt , is in love with her , but she dismisses it , deciding that she is too young to have a mate . However , Snowfur wants a Clanmate named Thistlepaw as a mate . A few moons later , Pinestar announces that he wants no more of the warrior life and goes off to live his last life as a housecat . Sunfall becomes Sunstar and Tawnyspots becomes the new deputy . On a patrol to RiverClan , Bluefur is pulled aside by Oakheart , who tells her to meet him that night at Fourtrees . She does , and the two warriors spend the night together , having fallen in love . About a month later , Tawnyspots falls ill with an incurable illness , so he is unable to be deputy for much longer . Thistlepaw , now Thistleclaw , wishes to become deputy in his place . Bluefur discovers that she is pregnant with Oakheart 's kits . ThunderClan believes her kits are with Thrushpelt and are overjoyed . After Goosefeather convinces her that she must become deputy , and not Thistleclaw due to his violence and ambition , Bluefur reluctantly brings her three kits ( Mosskit , Mistykit , and Stonekit ) , to RiverClan to live as RiverClan cats . Mosskit dies along the way . Bluefur then convinces ThunderClan that a fox or other creature took her kits . Once Featherwhisker deems Tawnyspots incurable and unfit for deputyship , Sunstar appoints Bluefur as the new deputy . After Sunstar dies , Bluefur becomes Bluestar and receives nine lives . Thistleclaw is outraged by this and continues to be bitter towards Bluestar until he was killed later on . </P> <P> Many months later , she is seen sitting with Spottedleaf , the medicine cat , and hears the `` Fire will save our Clan '' prophecy .

Feeling rejected , Crookedkit is visited in a dream by Mapleshade , a Dark Forest cat who allows Crookedkit to believe that she is from StarClan . She tells him that she can give him anything he wants as long as he is faithful to his Clan and puts all other things aside . Crookedkit quickly accepts this promise , believing it not to be a difficult promise , as he was already loyal to his Clan , and believes that Mapleshade can help him become leader .

When Crookedstar confronts Mapleshade , she reveals that she had once been the mate of Crookedstar 's great - grandfather .

Initially , Holmes was not very enthusiastic , since she `` could n't imagine coming up with enough ideas '' . She worked with the concept , however , expanding the storyline with elements of war , politics , revenge , doomed love , and religious conflict . Although the original plan was a stand - alone novel , enough material was created for several books , and the publisher decided on a six - volume series . The first volume , Into the Wild , was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym `` Erin Hunter '' and was completed in about three months . Holmes then began to work behind the scenes , editing and supervising details . Cherith Baldry joined the team to write the third book , Forest of Secrets . Later , after she wrote the first Warriors field guide , Tui Sutherland became the fourth Erin Hunter . </P> <P> The authors have named several other authors as sources of inspiration when writing the novels . In an online author chat , Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as including Tolkien , Ursula K. Le Guin , and Shakespeare . In the same chat , Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson , Kathy Reichs , and J.K. Rowling are some of the authors that inspire her . According to the official website , other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton , Lucy Daniels , Ellis Peters , Tess Gerritsen , Kate Ellis , Lisa Gardiner , and Meg Cabot . The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration . The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place . Other influential locations include Loch Lomond , as well as the Scottish Highlands . Nicholas Culpeper , a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine , also had an influence on the Warriors series . His book , Culpeper 's Herbal , is used as a source by the authors for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books . In addition , the authors suggested that they may use some fan - created names in future books . Also mentioned as a source of inspiration was the film series Rambo . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first book of the series , Into the Wild , was generally well - received , with reviewers calling it a `` spine - tingling , '' `` thoroughly engrossing '' and `` exciting ... action - packed adventure . '' One reviewer praised the authors for `` creating an intriguing world ... and an engaging young hero '' , but another criticised the characters and imagined world as being `` neither ... consistent nor compelling . '' </P> <P> The manga has also earned praise : a reviewer for Children 's Bookwatch noted that Into the Woods `` ends on a tense cliffhanger , leaving the reader in anxious anticipation for more . Suitable for readers age ten to one hundred and ten , Warriors Tigerstar & Sasha # 1 : Into the Woods is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere '' . Its sequel , Escape from the Forest , was also well reviewed : a reviewer for Publishers Weekly believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his `` growing violence '' . The art was also praised , with the reviewer writing that `` Hudson 's artwork brings Sasha 's emotional journey to life , showing each moment of fear , anxiety , contentment and joy . The cat 's - eye perspective of many of the panels , in addition , add ( sic ) a dramatic , energizing element to the book '' . The reviewer also wrote that `` a twist at the end will leave fans eager for the next installment of Sasha 's saga '' , and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world . Lisa Goldstein for School Library Journal also gave the book a positive review , writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans . The reviewer also wrote that `` though the cover claims that this is a ' manga , ' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple , realistic style '' . </P> <P> The large number of characters involved in the series has often been seen as a negative point ; though one reviewer compared the `` huge cast '' to that of a Greek drama , others wrote that it was `` hard to follow '' and `` a little confusing . '' The characters have also been criticised as being `` somewhat flat '' and `` limited essentially to each individual 's function within the clan . '' </P> <P> As one reviewer put it , the cats in the series are `` true to their feline nature , '' leading some critics to jokingly comment that the books will `` leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously '' and wondering `` what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat . '' However , this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence , with one critic stating that it is `` not for the faint of heart . '' Several critics have compared Warriors to Brian Jacques ' Redwall series , though one commented that it was `` not as elegantly written . '' The New York Times called the series a `` hit with young readers '' , specifically because of its `` sprawling universe '' , and the series was able to appear on the New York Times Bestseller List for a total of 117 weeks , as of 24 November 2013 . </P> <H3> Awards and recognitions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Into the Wild was nominated for the Pacific Northwest Library Association 's 2006 Young Reader 's Choice Awards but lost to Christopher Paolini 's Eragon . It was also listed on Booklist 's Top 10 fantasy books for youth in 2003 and was a Book Sense 76 Pick . The Sight was nominated for the best Middle Readers book in Amazon 's Best Books of the Year ( 2007 ) and placed sixth out of the ten nominees , with six percent of the total votes . It was also nominated for the Children 's Choice Book Awards . In 2006 , Warriors also received an honorable mention for the best book series for Publisher Weekly 's `` On the Cuff '' awards . </P> <H2> Themes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Themes in the series often revolve around forbidden love , such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart , Graystripe and Silverstream , Leafpool and Crowfeather , and Dovewing and Tigerheart . These relationships are not allowed for various reasons : some involve medicine cats ( such as Leafpool ) , who can not have mates , while others develop between cats in different Clans , which is forbidden by the warrior code . Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on `` faith and spirituality '' in StarClan . All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan , not just as the cats think of them , but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true . Some scenes take place within StarClan 's realm , with no living cats present as point - of - view characters . Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series . Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other . For example , the Tribe of Rushing Water , which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans , is introduced in Moonrise . In an author chat , Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are `` equally valid . '' This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand . Holmes said that `` ignorance is a very scary thing ! '' Non-belief is also significant in the storylines : Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan . </P> <P> Another theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil . Holmes has said she is fascinated by these `` shades of gray '' in personalities . Her example of this was when Bluestar , a noble and honorable cat , gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over . Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar , even with all of his faults , is still courageous and fiercely loyal . Similarly , Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil . A third major theme , often referred to as nature versus nurture , explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be , or if other things shape that . For example , Brambleclaw 's father is the evil Tigerstar , but he eventually demonstrates that despite this , he is not evil himself , despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father 's legacy . This theme ties into the `` shades of gray '' theme . </P> <P> A reviewer for Publishers Weekly noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels , while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that , just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life , people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life . A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that `` it does n't matter where you come from , only who you are inside '' . In Dawn , the importance of cooperation is explored . The four Clans , normally hostile to each other , are forced to work together in order to find a new home . Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family , loss , honor , bravery , death , loyalty , and following rules . </P> <P> Holmes has said that one of the good things about writing a book about cats is that `` we can tackle difficult human issues such as death , racial intolerance , and religious intolerance ( without seeming so heavy ) . '' </P> <H2> Editions ( edit ) </H2> <P> All of the Warriors books except for the manga have been published as hardcovers , and the majority of them have also been published as paperbacks . Starlight , Twilight , and Sunset from The New Prophecy , as well as the first four Omen of the Stars books , are available in an audiobook format . The New Prophecy audiobooks are spoken by Nanette Savard , whose performance has been praised by reviewers . A reviewer for AudioFile wrote : `` Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger . '' The Omen of the Stars audiobooks are spoken by Kathleen McInerney , a pseudonym of Veronica Taylor . The books in the four main series have also been released in an e-book format . </P> <H3> Foreign Editions ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Warriors series was first published in the United States and United Kingdom . The editions published of the first two series -- Warriors and Warriors : The New Prophecy -- in the United Kingdom had slight variations in cover design from their United States counterparts . Warriors is also sold in New Zealand , Australia , and Canada . Translations from English into other languages such as Czech , Lithuanian , Finnish , Japanese , French , Spanish , Russian , Chinese , and Korean have been published more recently . The first six books have been published in Korea , Italy and Latin America , the first five series in Germany and the first three series in the Netherlands . Fandom also exists in Trinidad and Singapore . The first two books have been published in Poland . </P> <H2> Other media ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Website ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Warriors website features Warriors screensavers , along with videos on the process of writing a manga book and a video promoting The Last Hope . There is also a `` How To Draw Manga '' page . In addition , there are games , including quizzes , the New Prophecy Adventure , and the Warriors Adventure Game . On the Frequently Asked Questions section of the site , Erin Hunter said that they are working on an online game that would be released in late 2010 . It finished the first round of testing in summer 2010 , but has not been released . Whether it will be a role - playing game is unknown . Erin Hunter has stated on the official Warriors website that there is still no plan for an official video game , but if there was , it would probably be based on a movie version of the Warriors series , which is currently not under consideration . Many fans have also created their own forum - based role - playing games . </P> <H3> Film ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Warriors ( live action film ) <P> On October 20 , 2016 , Victoria Holmes announced that Alibaba Pictures has bought the rights for a film , and is planning to do one with David Heyman set as producer . </P> <H3> Short stories ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first short story written by Erin Hunter is `` Spottedleaf 's Honest Answer '' . In it , the spirit of former ThunderClan medicine cat Spottedleaf discusses her love for Firestar . It gives information on what happened in the Warriors series from Into the Wild to Firestar 's Quest . </P> <P> On 20 January 2009 , another short story , `` The Clans Decide '' , was released on the Warriors Ultimate Leader Election site , starring Firestar , who won an election through an online fan vote conducted in recognition of President Obama 's Inauguration Day . In the story , the four Clans vote for a way to survive a tough winter . Every cat at the meeting votes on whether or not the Clans should work together to survive the winter . The cats vote in favour of working together . </P> <P> Two short stories , `` After Sunset : The Right Choice ? '' and `` The Elders ' Concern '' , are included with the Warriors mobile application . `` The Elders ' Concern '' has been noted to contain timeline errors . Taking place after Bluestar 's selection of Fireheart for deputy , it is about the elder Halftail , who is unhappy with the decision , and wakes the other elders to discuss it with them . In `` After Sunset : The Right Choice ? '' , After Brambleclaw is forced to kill Hawkfrost , he is worried about what Firestar might do , but Firestar is extremely proud of him . </P> <H3> Plays ( edit ) </H3> <P> Written by Victoria Holmes for a tour , a play titled After Sunset : We Need to Talk was first premiered on 28 April 2007 at the Secret Garden bookstore in Seattle , Washington . It details a meeting between Leafpool of ThunderClan and Crowfeather of WindClan after the events of Sunset . The script was released to the public on the official site for the Warriors series . </P> <P> During a fundraising event in Russellville , Arkansas , Brightspirit 's Mercy was performed by various high school drama students . The second of two plays by Erin Hunter , Brightspirit 's Mercy is about Jaypaw , Lionblaze , and Hollyleaf . After going to a Gathering , where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving , three cats from StarClan appear to them : Brightspirit and her parents , Shiningheart and Braveheart , characters created on Wands and Worlds , a fantasy fiction forum , in memory of a 10 - year - old Warriors fan , Emmy Grace Cherry , and her parents , Dana and Jimmy Cherry , who were killed in a tornado in February 2007 . They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans . Jaypaw is easily convinced , but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over . Eventually , they agree and hunt , then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol . Ashfoot , WindClan 's deputy , accepts the gift , but Breezepaw , too proud to have help from another Clan , refuses to eat it . Jaypaw , Lionblaze , and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan 's territory . </P> <P> </P> An example of a cat named Brambleclaw on a Chinese trading card . <P> In the Chinese translation of the series , `` 3 - D trading cards '' are packaged in each book . The 3 - D effect is produced using stereoscopic lenticular printing . These cards feature pictures of the cats on the centre of the bookcover and their Chinese and English names , and biographical information on the back . Current cards feature Firestar , Bluestar , Tallstar , Graystripe , Tigerstar , a collage of the 5 previous cats , Brambleclaw , Feathertail , Leafpool , Onestar , Crowfeather , Hawkfrost , Hollyleaf , Jayfeather , Lionblaze , Blackstar , Squirrelflight , Breezepelt , Sandstorm , Oakheart , Leafstar , Crookedstar , Yellowfang , Dovewing , Ivypool , Flametail , Stormfur , Tigerheart , and Spottedleaf . Also produced are puzzles and cups with Warriors images . </P> <H3> Mobile application ( edit ) </H3> <P> On 30 June 2011 , an official iOS application and Android application was released on the iTunes App Store and Play store . It contains information about the books in the series , profiles of the Clans and major characters ( including app - exclusive information such as the name of Firestar 's mother ) , an interactive timeline and maps , two application - exclusive short stories , and a trivia game . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Archipelago , World . `` Warriors Super Edition : Hawkwing 's Journey - Erin Hunter - Hardcover '' .

The films are updated re-imaginings of the events depicted in the manga , and include additional details , new characters and minor alterations to some events . The series spans three theatrical films and two OVAs , each focusing on a different character from the manga . These were released in Japan during a three - year span between 2006 and 2008 , culminating with the 25th anniversary of the original manga . The first film , as well as both OVAs , were distributed by Toho . A portion of the project 's budget came from a trust fund established by SMBC Friend Securities , which raised over 23 billion yen . </P> <P> The voice cast includes Hiroshi Abe as Kenshiro , Takashi Ukaji as Raoh , Yuriko Ishida as Yuria , and Kou Shibasaki as Reina ( a new character ) , all of whom were live - action actors with little voice acting experience prior to the production of the movies . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Films <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Legend of Raoh : Chapter of Death in Love </Li> <Li> 1.2 Legend of Yuria </Li> <Li> 1.3 Legend of Raoh : Chapter of Fierce Fight </Li> <Li> 1.4 Legend of Toki </Li> <Li> 1.5 Zero : Legend of Kenshiro </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Characters <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Characters from the original manga </Li> <Li> 2.2 New characters </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> <Li> 4 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Films ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Legend of Raoh : Chapter of death in love ( edit ) </H3> <P> Legend of Raoh : Chapter of Death in Love ( ラオウ 伝 殉愛 の 章 , Raō Den : Jun'ai no Shō ) is a feature - length film released on March 11 , 2006 , rated PG12 in Japan due to violent content . The DVD release of the film features over 500 additional frames of animation , as well as re-recorded dialogue by Takashi Ukaji ( the voice of Raoh ) , resulting in a few differences from its theatrical release . The movie grossed only $862,681 </P> <P> The film adapts the Holy Emperor story arc , depicting the conflict between Kenshiro and Thouzer , but introduces a new heroine named Reina , one of Raoh 's army officers who falls in love with him . She and her brother Soga , Raoh 's advisor , play an important part with much of the plot involving Raoh 's relationship with Reina as he conquers the land ; most of this portion is new content exclusive to this film . The other side of the story is the retelling of Ken 's attempt to save and protect the villagers from Thouzer 's army with the help of Shew . There is also a small subplot of Bat returning to his home . </P> <H3> Legend of Yuria ( edit ) </H3> <P> Legend of Yuria ( ユリア 伝 , Yuria Den ) is an hour - long OVA released on February 23 , 2007 . It features a somewhat original storyline because it presents the story from Yuria 's perspective , spanning from her childhood , including the day she first met Kenshiro , to the conclusion of the previous film , as well as certain scenes from the manga and anime in which Yuria was not present . This story is the most expansive of the series , even covering never before seen events from Yuria 's childhood , revealing both her mother and father , as well as her brother Ryūga during his childhood . It also adds some details that were not in the manga , such as the time and place when Yuria developed her illness , her meeting with Rei ( making his only appearance in the series ) , and her transition to the role of the Nanto General . One of the more notable additions is Yuria 's dog Tobi , who serves an important role in the relationship between her and Ken . The OVA concludes with the battle between Kenshiro and Thouzer and sets up the plot of the next movie . </P> <H3> Legend of Raoh : Chapter of fierce fight ( edit ) </H3> <P> Legend of Raoh : Chapter of Fierce Fight ( ラオウ 伝 激闘 の 章 , Raō Den Gekitō no Shō ) is the second feature - length film in this series , released in Japanese thraters on April 28 , 2007 . Nobuaki Kakuda voices the character of Akashachi the Pirate . To promote the release of the film , a mock funeral for Raoh was held at the Koyasan Tokyo Betsuin for ten days , beginning on April 10 , 2007 . Shinji Tanimura served as the funeral director , while Takashi Ukaji gave the memorial address . Nearly 3,000 fans attended the event . This film fared slightly better at the box office at $1,479,911 </P> <P> The film adapts the Last Nanto General story arc from the manga , depicting the final battle between Kenshiro and Raoh that led to Kenshiro becoming the successor of Hokuto Shinken . Some events from the manga have been excluded from the movie ( such as Raoh 's fight with Juza ) whereas others have been altered or expanded . New content featuring the final battle from Raoh 's perspective have been added . This film serves as the follow - up to the first film in the series , which introduced Raoh and Reina 's relationship , this time bringing it to a conclusion . </P> <H3> Legend of Toki ( edit ) </H3> <P> Legend of Toki ( トキ 伝 , Toki Den ) is an hour - long OVA released on March 26 , 2008 . It centers around Toki and his relationship with his brother Raoh , leading up to Toki 's imprisonment in Cassandra and eventually his duel with Raoh . The OVA introduces another new character named Sara , a female doctor who watches over Toki and becomes his love interest . </P> <H3> Zero : Legend of Kenshiro ( edit ) </H3> <P> Zero : Legend of Kenshiro ( ZERO ケンシロウ 伝 , Zero Kenshirō Den ) , the fifth and final entry in the series , is a feature - length film released theatrically on October 11 , 2008 . Similarly to the funeral that was held to promote the second Raoh film , a wedding event was held at the Nippon Seinenkan Grand Hall on September 13 , 2008 ( coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the Weekly Shōnen Jump debut of Hokuto no Ken ) to promote the film . Keiichi Nanba and Miina Tominaga ( who voiced the adult versions of Bat and Rin in the 1987 Hokuto no Ken 2 TV series ) played supporting characters in this movie along with Takeshi Aono ( the original voice of Rihaku ) . </P> <P> The film serves as a prequel to the original manga , depicting the one year interval between Kenshiro 's defeat at the hands of Shin and their later battle . Unlike the prior movies , this film has a completely original storyline in which Kenshiro , near death after his battle with Shin and having used his remaining energy to kill a pack of wolves , was captured by slavers . Due to his strength , Kenshiro could escape whenever he wanted , but chose to stay and protect the other slaves . This experience further explores what reinforces Kenshiro 's resolve to fight for the innocent and to bring justice upon the wicked in the post apocalyptic wasteland as the Savior of Century 's End . </P> <H2> Characters ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Characters from the original manga ( edit ) </H3> Further information : List of Fist of the North Star characters <Dl> <Dt> Kenshiro ( ケンシロウ , Kenshirō ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Hiroshi Abe </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Raoh ( ラオウ , Raō ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Takashi Ukaji </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Yuria ( ユリア ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Yuriko Ishida </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Toki ( トキ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Ken'yū Horiuchi </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Ryūken ( リュウケン ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Chikao Ōtsuka </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Bat ( バット , Batto ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Daisuke Namikawa </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Rin ( リン , Rin ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Maaya Sakamoto </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Thouzer ( サウザー , Sauzā ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Akio Ōtsuka </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Shin ( シン ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Takuya Kirimoto </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Fudoh ( フドウ , Fudō ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Daisuke Gōri </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Shuren ( シュレン ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Nobuyuki Hiyama </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Rihaku ( リハク ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Katsuhisa Hōki </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Shū ( シュウ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Hōchū Ōtsuka </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Rei ( レイ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Shin - ichiro Miki </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Jagi ( ジャギ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : David Ito </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Hyūi ( ヒューイ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Hiroshi Tsuchida </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Tō ( トウ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Yūko Kaida </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Ryūga ( リュウガ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Daisuke Sakaguchi </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Barga ( バルガ , Baruga ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Masaki Terasoma </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dt> Akashachi ( 赤 鯱 ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Nobuaki Kakuda </Dd> </Dl> <H3> New characters ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dt> Reina ( レイナ ) </Dt> <Dd> Voiced by : Kou Shibasaki </Dd> <Dd> Introduced in Chapter of Death in Love , she is a childhood friend of Raoh , and determined female general of his cavalry .

{"document_text": "England national Football team manager - wikipedia <H1> England national Football team manager </H1> <P> </P> Gareth Southgate , the current England national football team manager <P> The role of an England national football team manager was first established in 1946 with the appointment of Walter Winterbottom . Before this , the England team was selected by the `` International Selection Committee '' , a process in which the Football Association ( FA ) would select coaches and trainers from the league to prepare the side for single games , but where all decisions ultimately remained under the control of the committee . A 1 -- 0 defeat by Switzerland prompted FA secretary Stanley Rous to raise Winterbottom from `` National Director of coaching '' to `` Manager '' . </P> <P> Eighteen men have occupied the post since its inception ; four of those were in short - term caretaker manager roles : Joe Mercer ( seven games in charge ) , Howard Wilkinson ( two games , a year apart from one another ) , Peter Taylor ( one game ) and Stuart Pearce ( one game ) . In comparison , Winterbottom held the position for the longest to date ; a tenure of 16 years , comprising four World Cups and a total of 139 matches . Alf Ramsey is the only manager to have won a major tournament , winning the 1966 World Cup with his `` Wingless Wonders '' . No other manager has progressed beyond the semi-finals of a major competition before or since , with only three managers achieving a semi-final appearance : Bobby Robson at the 1990 World Cup , Terry Venables at Euro 1996 , and Gareth Southgate at the 2018 World Cup . </P> <P> Swedish coach Sven - Göran Eriksson became the first foreign manager of the team in January 2001 amid much acrimony ; he helped the team to three successive quarter - finals in major championships . Italian manager Fabio Capello replaced Steve McClaren in December 2007 , after England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 . Capello 's side endured a lacklustre performance during the 2010 World Cup , but the FA confirmed that he would remain in the role . However , Capello resigned in February 2012 , following a disagreement with the FA over their removal of John Terry 's captaincy . He was replaced , on a caretaker basis , by Stuart Pearce , before Roy Hodgson was named as Capello 's permanent replacement in May 2012 . Hodgson 's contract finished on 27 June 2016 as England were knocked out of UEFA Euro 2016 by Iceland in the round of 16 . Sam Allardyce was announced as his successor a month later , but subsequently left the role after just one competitive match . He was replaced on a caretaker basis by England under - 21 coach and former England international defender Gareth Southgate , whose position was made permanent after four matches . </P> <P> The England manager 's job is subject to intense press scrutiny , often including revelations about the incumbent 's private life . Due to the high level of expectation of both the public and media the role has been described as `` the impossible job '' or compared in importance in national culture to that of the British Prime Minister . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Position <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Role </Li> <Li> 1.2 Appointment </Li> <Li> 1.3 National significance </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Full - time era begins ( 1946 -- 62 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 World Cup success ( 1962 -- 74 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3 Turbulent times ( 1974 -- 82 ) </Li> <Li> 2.4 Robson and `` The Hand of God '' ( 1982 -- 90 ) </Li> <Li> 2.5 Controversial times ( 1990 -- 2002 ) </Li> <Li> 2.6 Foreign management ( 2002 -- 12 ) </Li> <Li> 2.7 Return to English appointees ( 2012 -- ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Media reaction <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Personal attacks </Li> <Li> 3.2 Issues - based </Li> <Li> 3.3 Private life </Li> <Li> 3.4 Campaigns </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Statistical summary </Li> <Li> 5 Statistical summary for British Home championships </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Position ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Role ( edit ) </H3> Former England manager Fabio Capello appointed only one Englishman on his coaching staff . <P> The England manager 's role means he has sole responsibility for all on - the - field elements of the England team . Among other activities , this includes selecting the national team squad , the starting team , captain , tactics , substitutes and penalty - takers . Before 1946 , the `` Select Committee '' ( as appointed by the FA ) would manage all issues barring the actual match day team selection , formation and tactics which was left to the head coach for the event . However interference was common , and not only from the FA . After the Second World War , with the relaunch of competitive international calendar , the manager 's role expanded to take in all elements : from the selection of hotel and training camp venues , through to food and travel arrangements . </P> <P> The manager is given a free hand in selecting his coaching ( `` back room '' ) staff . For example , in 2008 Fabio Capello appointed four Italians ( Franco Baldini as general manager , Italo Galbiati as assistant coach , Franco Tancredi as goalkeeping coach and Massimo Neri as fitness coach ) ; he then appointed Englishman Stuart Pearce , the England under - 21s coach , as an England coach , with Capello stating `` From the start I made it clear that I wanted an English coach as part of my coaching team . '' </P> <P> The England manager may also involve himself in wider issues beyond the on - the - field team issues . The England manager is expected to advise the FA on how to approach the complex bidding system that surrounds the arrangement of fixtures for a qualifying campaign . On a more tactical level , a host of other details can be influenced ; Capello is even believed to have instructed the Wembley Stadium ball boys to return balls at speed when they go out of play . </P> <H3> Appointment ( edit ) </H3> <P> The process of appointing a new England manager is undertaken by an FA committee , comprising board members and other high - ranking FA officials . For example , the members of the selection panel which appointed Sven - Göran Eriksson in 2001 were : chief executive Adam Crozier , chairman Geoff Thompson , vice-chairman Dave Richards , club chairmen and FA board members David Dein and Peter Ridsdale , and technical director Howard Wilkinson . </P> <H3> National significance ( edit ) </H3> <P> The England manager 's job has been compared in importance to that of the Prime Minister . Passion for football as England 's national sport is coupled with patriotism and Wembley Stadium as the `` home '' of football . The dismissal or appointment of an England manager is front - page news and the subject of intense interest . Large sums are wagered on England winning , and during tournaments the country is festooned in Saint George 's flags ; during the 2006 World Cup , 27 % of English adults bought a flag in one month alone . Shops and offices will be deserted as vast numbers of people watch the game . </P> <P> The England manager 's job is made more complex by his dependence on the co-operation of clubs and their managers in releasing players for friendlies , and `` club versus country '' conflict is said to have happened when permission is refused , given reluctantly , or negotiated . There are also repeated comments that the length of the English season ( the top flight plays 38 league matches ) is unhelpful for preparing tired players for major tournaments , but the self - interest of the Premier League makes a reduction in the number of games unlikely , particularly in light of the 2008 proposal for Game 39 , a match played between Premier League clubs outside the country . This combination of factors , coupled with England 's mediocre record in major championships has led to the England manager 's job being described as the `` impossible job '' . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Full - time era begins ( 1946 -- 62 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Before 1946 , the England national football team had been under the leadership of a Football Association ( FA ) official and a trainer , usually from a London club . Appointed in 1946 , initially as chief coach , Walter Winterbottom had been a member of the FA `` International Selection Committee '' . The England squad was selected by an FA committee during his tenure , with Winterbottom 's role restricted to selecting the starting team together with the coaching and tactics . In his first game as manager , he led England to a 7 -- 2 victory over Ireland at Windsor Park , Belfast in the 1946 -- 47 British Home Championship . Success in the Home Championship in 1950 resulted in England 's qualification to the 1950 World Cup in Brazil . During the tournament , England suffered a shock defeat against the United States , and went out of the tournament with another 1 -- 0 defeat , this time to Spain . </P> <P> England experienced another surprise upset under Winterbottom 's guidance in 1953 when Hungary defeated England 6 -- 3 at Wembley Stadium . Winterbottom said afterwards , `` ... The press tended to think we would win easily , but I tried to point out that the Hungarians were actually a great side . '' He guided England to first place in the 1953 -- 54 British Home Championship , which qualified the team for the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland , but saw his side knocked out in the quarter - finals , going down 4 -- 2 against Uruguay . Three wins and a draw from four matches enabled England 's qualification for the 1958 World Cup , only for Winterbottom 's side to fail in the group play - off stage , losing 1 -- 0 to the Soviet Union . England lost to Brazil in the quarter - final of the 1962 World Cup in Chile and , under attack from the British press , Winterbottom resigned five months later . He remains the longest serving manager of England . </P> <H3> World Cup success ( 1962 -- 74 ) ( edit ) </H3> Alf Ramsey managed the England team that won the 1966 World Cup . <P> Alf Ramsey took control of the team in 1962 , but unlike Winterbottom , Ramsey had been a club manager , winning the League championship with Ipswich Town . Upon his appointment , he declared England would win the 1966 World Cup . His first match in charge resulted in a 5 -- 2 loss at Parc des Princes against France . England automatically qualified for the 1966 World Cup as hosts and , after a goalless draw in the first match against Uruguay , four consecutive victories saw England through to the final against West Germany . A 4 -- 2 victory , after extra time , won England the World Cup for the only time . As a result of his and England 's achievements , Ramsey was awarded a knighthood in 1967 . The following year England finished third at Euro 1968 in Rome , but Ramsey reflected `` We are world champions . Third place is not our real position . '' </P> <P> Automatic qualification for the 1970 World Cup was secured as world champions so Ramsey led England on a pre-tournament tour of South America . The effects of altitude on the team led Ramsey to appoint the first full - time team doctor , Neil Phillips , who helped prepare the squad for the forthcoming tournament in Mexico . England were defeated in the quarter - final by West Germany ; with a 2 -- 0 lead with 25 minutes of the match remaining , Ramsey substituted Bobby Charlton and goalscorer Martin Peters , but West Germany went on to win 3 -- 2 after extra time . Ramsey was heavily criticised in the British press for the substitutions . Losing out to West Germany again , this time in a two - legged qualifying play - off for Euro 1972 , Ramsey prepared England for qualification for the 1974 World Cup . Needing a win against Poland , Ramsey 's tactical use of substitutions was again called into question as the match ended in a 1 -- 1 draw . England had failed to qualify for the World Cup , and Ramsey was dismissed the following May . </P> <H3> Turbulent Times ( 1974 -- 82 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Joe Mercer took control of the team on a caretaker basis for seven matches , before the FA appointed Don Revie on a five - year contract . It was a year before Revie 's England suffered a defeat but despite this , he changed his starting line - up for every game . His relationship with the FA had broken down and his team - building exercises , including carpet bowls and indoor golf , led to disconsolation in the squad . A 2 -- 0 defeat to the Netherlands at Wembley Stadium turned the press against him ; some commentators compared the loss to the 6 -- 3 defeat by Hungary in 1953 . Convinced he was to be replaced by Bobby Robson , he announced he was to become manager of the United Arab Emirates team . Selling his story to the Daily Mail , he subsequently resigned on 11 July 1977 . Revie was charged with bringing the game into disrepute and was banned by the FA in a `` kangaroo court '' for ten years . On appeal to the High Court , the ban was overturned but the judge ordered Revie to pay two - thirds of the costs . Brian Clough applied for the position in 1977 , but the FA rejected him and Ron Greenwood was appointed , initially as a temporary replacement for Revie , but later in 1977 on a permanent basis . Bobby Moore described him as `` the encyclopaedia of football '' , and he guided England to Euro 1980 without a defeat during qualification . </P> <P> The team exited the tournament at the group stage and Greenwood turned his attention to qualification for the 1982 World Cup in Spain . Defeats in Switzerland and Romania led Greenwood to consider resignation , but a victory over Hungary convinced him to stay . A 2 -- 1 defeat in Oslo , which led to commentator Bjørge Lillelien 's famous outburst concluding with `` Your boys took a hell of a beating ! '' , meant England required at least a point in their final qualifying game against Hungary . A Paul Mariner goal secured victory and qualification for the team . Wins over France , Czechoslovakia and Kuwait allowed England into the second round group but two 0 -- 0 draws ended in England going out of the tournament , without having lost a game . Greenwood retired immediately after the World Cup and on 7 July 1982 , two days after England were knocked out of the 1982 World Cup , Bobby Robson was appointed England manager , selecting former West Bromwich Albion teammate Don Howe as his chief coach . </P> <H3> Robson and `` the hand of God '' ( 1982 -- 90 ) ( edit ) </H3> Bobby Robson managed England from 1982 to 1990 . <P> Robson 's tenure included 28 qualifying matches , of which only one , against Denmark in 1983 , resulted in a defeat . This contributed to England 's failure to qualify for Euro 1984 , and Robson offered his resignation . It was rejected by the FA chairman , Bert Millichip , and Robson went on to lead the England team to qualify for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico . England were defeated in the quarter - final by Argentina with a brace of goals from Diego Maradona ; the infamous `` Hand of God '' goal , and the `` Goal of the Century '' he scored five minutes later . </P> <P> Robson 's England dropped only one point in qualifying for Euro 1988 , which included an 8 -- 0 win over Turkey . However , this was followed by failure at the tournament itself , held in West Germany , where England were knocked out in the group stage . They finished bottom of their group , succumbing to defeats against the Republic of Ireland , the Netherlands and the Soviet Union . Robson was vilified by the British press , and after a draw in a friendly with Saudi Arabia , one newspaper demanded : `` In the name of Allah , go '' . Robson led England without conceding a goal through qualification for the 1990 World Cup . </P> <P> As in the 1986 World Cup , Robson was denied the service of his captain , Bryan Robson , who suffered an achilles tendon injury which prevented him playing in the latter stages of the tournament . England topped their group , accumulating four points from their three games . However their progress was not without controversy . England changed formation from their traditional 4 -- 4 -- 2 to incorporate a sweeper , with some sources suggesting this was due to player revolt after the 1 -- 1 draw in the first match with the Republic of Ireland . Robson denies this claim in his autobiography . This was followed by victories over Belgium and Cameroon in the knock - out stages , to set up a semi-final with West Germany . </P> <P> England lost the match on a penalty shoot - out , after the score had been level at 1 -- 1 following extra time . Robson 's last public appearance before his death from cancer was at the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match in July 2009 , played between veterans from that 1990 semi-final as a tribute to his life and in aid of his cancer charity . </P> <H3> Controversial Times ( 1990 -- 2002 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robson had announced before the tournament that he would step down from the post after the finals and Graham Taylor was appointed , having been approached in April 1990 by the FA . Failure to proceed past the group stage of Euro 1992 with a 2 -- 1 defeat against Sweden led to newspaper headlines such as `` Swedes 2 Turnips 1 '' and Taylor 's nickname of `` Turnip Head '' . Following defeat to the Netherlands in the penultimate qualifying match for the 1994 World Cup , for only the third time in its history , England had failed to qualify for the World Cup . The qualifying campaign was recorded in a television documentary , and Taylor 's remark `` Do I not like that '' soon after entered popular culture . </P> Glenn Hoddle managed England from 1996 to 1998 . <P> Failure in the qualification resulted in Taylor resigning , and Terry Venables took over the helm in 1994 . As England were hosts for Euro 1996 , he did not manage the team in a competitive match for over two years . In January 1996 , he announced that he would resign after the tournament as a result of several court cases , but led England to the semi-finals , where they were defeated by Germany on penalties . He was replaced by Glenn Hoddle , whose unorthodox off - the - field approach in bringing in faith healer Eileen Drewery to help the team drew significant criticism . Hoddle suggested she was `` more of an agony aunt '' but during the 1998 World Cup , the press suggested Drewery had influenced Hoddle in squad selection . England were knocked out of the tournament in the second round , once again on penalties , this time against Argentina . Hoddle 's diary portraying his version of events at the World Cup was subsequently published , drawing further criticism . </P> <P> An interview with Matt Dickinson , a reporter from The Times , suggested that Hoddle had a `` controversial belief that the disabled , and others , are being punished for sins in a former life . '' Hoddle 's comments were criticised by several notable politicians , including Sports Minister Tony Banks and Prime Minister Tony Blair . Hoddle stated that he was not prepared to resign and claimed his words were misinterpreted and pointed out his contributions and commitment to organisations helping the disabled . The FA terminated Hoddle 's contract soon afterwards , which was welcomed by representatives of disabled groups . </P> <P> Howard Wilkinson was caretaker manager for two games , before the appointment of Kevin Keegan in February 1999 . Initially combining the job with a role at Fulham , Keegan was made full - time coach in May . He led England to qualification for Euro 2000 following success in a two - legged play - off against Scotland . Two 3 -- 2 losses resulted in England leaving the tournament at the group stage . A loss to Germany in the last international match at the old Wembley Stadium in the first 2002 World Cup qualifying match led to Keegan 's resignation . Keegan resigned an hour after the team was booed off by England fans ; he told the FA officials that he felt `` a little short at this level '' . Wilkinson again returned as caretaker for one more match , followed by Peter Taylor who presided over a friendly loss to Italy . </P> <H3> Foreign management ( 2002 -- 12 ) ( edit ) </H3> Sven - Göran Eriksson , from Sweden , became England 's first foreign manager . Eriksson led England to the quarter - finals of the 2002 World Cup . <P> The FA then took the unprecedented , and widely criticised step of appointing the first non-Englishman as coach , in the form of Swede Sven - Göran Eriksson . Eriksson had a good record in European domestic football , with success in Portugal and Italy , and had led clubs to win the UEFA Cup on two occasions . He led England to qualify for the 2002 World Cup with David Beckham scoring the vital equaliser against Greece , deep into injury time . England were knocked out by Brazil in the quarter - finals and Eriksson came under fire for his `` ice - cool '' appearance on the touchline failing to inspire his team , senior player Gareth Southgate remarking after the tournament that `` we needed Winston Churchill but we got Iain Duncan Smith '' . </P> <P> Eriksson led England to qualification for Euro 2004 but once more the team fell at the quarter - final stage , again losing on penalties , this time to Portugal . Losing 1 -- 0 to Northern Ireland in Belfast during the qualification for the 2006 World Cup led to fans chanting `` Sack the Swede '' , frustrated again at the lack of obvious emotion in Eriksson while his coach , Steve McClaren , was much more animated . </P> <P> In January 2006 , the FA announced that Eriksson would stand down after the World Cup . With the team losing in the quarter - final again to Portugal and again on penalties , Eriksson duly left the post in July . The search for Eriksson 's replacement was controversial . It became clear that the FA wanted to appoint Luiz Felipe Scolari , but the approach was botched , and Scolari turned down the offer . Ultimately , Eriksson was replaced by the man who had coached the side under him , Steve McClaren . </P> <P> Qualification for Euro 2008 proved too much , England losing the final qualifier against Croatia 3 -- 2 in November 2007 , when a draw would have been enough to take England to the finals . The British press turned on McClaren , former Scottish international Alan Hansen stating that `` ... what McClaren should be held accountable for is that with a squad of this quality he failed to qualify from what seemed a reasonably straightforward group ... '' . McClaren was dismissed the day following the defeat to Croatia , and was replaced in December 2007 by Italian Fabio Capello . The defeat to Croatia is remembered in the sports press for the infamous moniker `` Wally with the Brolly '' . A reference to McLaren 's pitchside prescence under an umbrella in a match played in heavy rain . </P> <P> Capello led England to qualification for the 2010 World Cup , winning nine of the team 's ten qualifying matches . However , the team 's performance in the tournament proper was less impressive . Two lacklustre draws in the group stage against the United States and Algeria were followed by an ignominious 4 -- 1 defeat by traditional rivals Germany in the Round of 16 . The team 's performance was at least partly attributed to selection and tactical errors by Capello and led to calls for his dismissal . However , on 2 July , the FA confirmed that he would remain in the role until 2012 , with Capello himself confirming his intention to step down and retire after Euro 2012 . </P> <P> Conflicting reports came out of the FA as to whether the next manager would be English . On 15 August 2010 , the FA 's Adrian Bevington stated to the BBC that `` we should have an English manager after ( Euro 2012 ) '' , but on 22 September , the FA 's Director of Football Development , Trevor Brooking , stated that `` We would like to go English ( but ) we 've got to see what English people are available '' . Two weeks later , Capello 's England qualified for Euro 2012 with a 2 -- 2 draw away against Montenegro . In February 2012 , Capello resigned following the FA 's decision to remove the captaincy of the national side from John Terry , with Englishman Stuart Pearce taking over the role on a caretaker basis . </P> <H3> Return to English appointees ( 2012 -- ) ( edit ) </H3> Roy Hodgson , England manager from 2012 to 2016 <P> Following a 3 -- 2 defeat at Wembley Stadium by the Netherlands in March , Pearce was replaced on 1 May 2012 by West Bromwich Albion manager Roy Hodgson on a four - year contract . Despite being based in Kraków in Poland , England 's first fixture in Euro 2012 was in Donetsk against France , which ended in a 1 -- 1 draw . Subsequent victories over Sweden and tournament co-hosts Ukraine resulted in a quarter - final match against Italy . The game ended goalless after extra time , sending the game to a penalty shoot - out which Italy won 4 -- 2 . Hodgson claimed that England 's exit from major tournaments had become a `` national obsession '' . With a 2 -- 0 victory over Poland in October 2013 , Hodgson led England to qualification for the 2014 World Cup . </P> <P> However , in the 2014 World Cup , England lost two consecutive group matches , against Italy and Uruguay , by 2 -- 1 on each occasion . This was the first time England had lost two group matches since the 1950 World Cup ( when they lost against the United States and Spain ) and the first time England had been eliminated at the group stage since the 1958 World Cup . This was also the first time that England had not won a match at the tournament since 1958 , and England 's points total of one from three matches was its worst ever in the World Cup . </P> <P> England qualified for UEFA Euro 2016 in September 2015 , following a 6 -- 0 win over San Marino . On 27 June 2016 , almost immediately after England were knocked out 2 -- 1 by Iceland in the round of 16 , Hodgson resigned as manager . </P> <P> On 22 July , Sam Allardyce was appointed England manager on a two - year contract . After only 67 days in the job , a video published by The Daily Telegraph showed Allardyce making insulting statements against former manager Roy Hodgson , and explaining how to circumvent regulations of The FA on third party ownership of players . He subsequently left the role as manager of England later that day . Former England international defender and England under - 21 coach Gareth Southgate was given the senior role on a caretaker basis for four matches while the FA considered their options . Two wins , including a 3 -- 0 victory over Scotland , and a draw in qualifying matches for the 2018 World Cup and a 2 -- 2 draw with Spain in a friendly followed under Southgate 's temporary management , before he was formally appointed to the position full - time on 30 November 2016 on a four - year deal . </P> <H2> Media reaction ( edit ) </H2> <P> The reaction of the British media to the England national team manager reflects the changing nature of the British media generally . In recent times , managers have been attacked personally , for their personal beliefs , or private lives . </P> <H3> Personal attacks ( edit ) </H3> The Sun front page , reporting Graham Taylor 's resignation <P> The press had long campaigned for changes in management style and / or replacement of the manager himself , but a watershed was reached under the tenure of Graham Taylor , whose unsuccessful reign led to the manager being pilloried in the tabloids . Most notably , The Sun newspaper reacted to a damaging defeat by Sweden at Euro 1992 , by the accompaniment of the headline `` Swedes 2 Turnips 1 '' with a photographic montage of a turnip superimposed on Taylor 's head . Taylor was thereafter often referred to in the media as `` Graham Turnip '' or `` Turnip Taylor '' . </P> <P> Subsequent footballing ignominies were then followed by other depictions of Taylor as a vegetable ; England 's first game after Euro 92 ended in a 1 -- 0 defeat to Spain , and The Sun pictured Taylor as a `` Spanish onion '' . When he resigned , following the loss of the 1994 World Cup spot to Norway , they reverted to the turnip image , accompanying the front - page headline , `` That 's yer allotment '' . </P> <P> Following Roy Hodgson 's appointment , The Sun mocked his rhotacism manner of speech with a `` Bwing on the Euwos ! '' front - page headline . The FA called the headline `` unacceptable '' and more than 100 people complained to the Press Complaints Commission . </P> <H3> Issues - based ( edit ) </H3> <P> Glenn Hoddle attracted the media spotlight for two key issues unrelated to on - the - pitch affairs . In the first , his reliance upon purported faith healer Eileen Drewery was questioned . Drewery became part of the official England staff , and players were pressured to see her , even though many of them were sceptical . However , far more opprobrium was caused by Hoddle 's comments about disabled people : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> You and I have been physically given two hands and two legs and half - decent brains . Some people have not been born like that for a reason . The karma is working from another lifetime . I have nothing to hide about that . It is not only people with disabilities . What you sow , you have to reap . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Public opinion , based upon the immediate media furore resulted in ( according to one BBC poll ) 90 % of respondents believing Hoddle should not continue as English coach . However , the BBC survey showed that while many considered his comments insensitive to the disabled , others defended his right to express his religious beliefs by claiming that to dismiss him would constitute religious discrimination . </P> <H3> Private life ( edit ) </H3> <P> Eriksson 's private life came under scrutiny , with a number of well - publicised accusations of trysts with women including Ulrika Jonsson , and FA secretary Faria Alam , despite his on - going relationship with Nancy Dell'Olio . Though Eriksson maintained in press conferences that his personal life was a private matter , his relationships with Jonsson in 2002 and Alam in 2004 were subject to tabloid headlines for several weeks . </P> <H3> Campaigns ( edit ) </H3> <P> The media , both broadsheet and tabloid , have sometimes campaigned for a manager to be dismissed , appointed or retained . Campaigns for managers to be dismissed have been front - page news , with eye - catching headlines including `` The final ron - devouz '' , `` In the Name of Allah Go '' , `` Norse Manure '' , `` Blair Gives Hoddle The Red Card '' for ( respectively ) Greenwood , Robson , Taylor and Hoddle . </P> <P> Eriksson survived several scandals whilst in office , but his tenure was eventually ended when he was one of a series of celebrities targeted by a tabloid ' sting ' , orchestrated by The Fake Sheikh , Mazher Mahmood . Eriksson 's indiscretions revealed by the newspaper `` ... proved the final straw for the FA '' , although Eriksson was permitted to stay on in the role until the end of the 2006 World Cup . </P> <P> These campaigns have also sometimes backfired . Former FA chief executive , Graham Kelly recalled a campaign , orchestrated by The Sun against Bobby Robson , that began in 1984 ( six years before his resignation ) : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The Sun was handing over `` Robson Out '' badges at England games as early as 1984 but the FA 's then chief executive , Graham Kelly , recalled that with every press attack , his backing increased . `` The irony was that just before the 1990 World Cup , the chairman , Bert Millichip , finally lost patience , let his tongue run away with him , and said that Robson either had to win the World Cup or go , and Bobby reacted by approaching PSV Eindhoven . Had this not happened , he would have served another four years , believe me . '' </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Sections of the media have often campaigned for a particular person to be appointed England manager . At various times , but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson , the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough . Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip `` I 'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brian -- give the job to him . If he 's successful , everybody 's happy . If he fails , that 's the end of the clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager . '' Robson added , `` He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but I think he would have been a good England manager . He had good judgement , knew how to design a team and was a great motivator . '' Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000 . </P> <P> Steve McClaren received media criticism , and , as failure to qualify for Euro 2008 looked increasingly likely , the headlines became more visceral . In January 2008 , football magazine When Saturday Comes described the newspaper coverage of his final month as `` relentless and remorseless '' . Both tabloids and broadsheets published critical pieces , with The Times headlining an editorial `` Fail and McClaren has to go '' . </P> <P> The media have also parodied this genre of campaigns for recruitment , dismissal or retention of managers .

Saudi Arabia crude oil production 1950 - 2012 <P> Saudi Arabian oil was first discovered by the Americans in commercial quantities at Dammam oil well No. 7 in 1938 in what is now modern day Dhahran . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Before the discovery of oil </Li> <Li> 2 Initial search </Li> <Li> 3 after Discovery of oil </Li> <Li> 4 Changes to the original concession </Li> <Li> 5 Tapline </Li> <Li> 6 1973 Arab - Israeli War </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Before the discovery of oil ( edit ) </H2> <P> On January 15 , 1902 , Ibn Saud took Riyadh from the Rashid tribe . In 1913 , his forces captured the province of al - Hasa from the Ottoman Turks . In 1922 , he completed his conquest of the Nejd , and in 1925 , he conquered the Hijaz . In 1932 , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was proclaimed with Ibn Saud as king . Without stability in the region , the search for oil would have been difficult , as evidenced by early oil exploration in neighbouring countries such as Yemen and Oman . </P> <P> Prior to 1938 , there were three main factors that triggered the search for oil in Arabia : </P> <Ul> <Li> The discovery of oil by the Anglo - Persian Oil Company at Masjid - i - Sulaiman in the mountains of north - western Persia in 1908 ; but the consensus of geological opinion at the time was that there was no oil on the Arabian peninsula , although there were rumours of an oil seepage at Qatif on the eastern seaboard of al - Hasa , the eastern province of Arabia . </Li> <Li> The demand for oil during World War I. It became obvious that oil was going to be a crucial resource in warfare for the foreseeable future . Examples that proved this were `` General Gallieni 's commandeering of the Paris taxi fleet to ferry soldiers to the front . This happened when the city seemed about to fall '' . In addition to this , Germany 's shortage of oil supplies hindered their ability to produce aircraft , automobiles , and engines . The allies took advantage of this by producing thousands of vehicles to aid their war effort . </Li> <Li> The onset of the Great Depression . Prior to the depression , a major source of income for the ruler of Hijaz was the taxes paid by pilgrims on their way to the holy cities . After the depression hit , the number of pilgrimages per year fell from 100,000 to below 40,000 . This hurt their economy greatly and they needed to find alternate sources of income . This caused Ibn Saud to get serious about the search for oil . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Initial search ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1922 , Ibn Saud met a New Zealand mining engineer named Major Frank Holmes . During World War I , Holmes had been to Gallipoli and then Ethiopia , where he first heard rumours of the oil seeps of the Persian Gulf region . He was convinced that much oil would be found throughout the region . After the war , Holmes helped to set up Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd in order , among other things , to seek oil concessions in the region . </P> <P> In 1923 , the king signed a concession with Holmes allowing him to search for oil in eastern Saudi Arabia . Eastern and General Syndicate brought in a Swiss geologist to evaluate the land but he claimed that searching for oil in Arabia would be `` a pure gamble '' . This discouraged the major banks and oil companies from investing in Arabian oil ventures . </P> <P> In 1925 , Holmes signed a concession with the sheikh of Bahrain , allowing him to search for oil there . He then proceeded to the United States to find an oil company that might be interested in taking on the concession . He found help from Gulf Oil . In 1927 , Gulf Oil took control of the concessions that Holmes made years ago . But Gulf Oil was a partner in the Iraq Petroleum Company , which was jointly owned by Royal Dutch / Shell , Anglo - Persian , the Compagnie Française des Pétroles , and `` the Near East Development Company , representing the interests of the American companies . The partners had signed up to the `` Red Line Agreement '' which meant that Gulf Oil was precluded from taking up the Bahrain concession without the consent of the other partners ; and they declined . Despite a promising survey in Bahrain , Gulf Oil was forced to transfer its interest to another company , Standard Oil of California ( SOCAL ) , which was not a bound by the Red Line Agreement . </P> <P> Meanwhile Ibn Saud had dispatched American mining engineer Karl Twitchell to examine eastern Arabia . Twitchell found encouraging signs of oil , asphalt seeps in the vicinity of Qatif , but advised the king to await the outcome of the Bahrain No. 1 well before inviting bids for a concession for al - Hasa . To the American engineers working in Bahrain , standing on the Jebel Dukhan and gazing across a twenty - mile ( 32 km ) stretch of the Persian Gulf at the Arabian Peninsula in the clear light of early morning , the outline of the low Dhahran hills in the distance were an obvious oil prospect . </P> <P> On 31 May 1932 , the SOCAL subsidiary , the Bahrain Petroleum Company ( BAPCO ) struck oil on Bahrain . The discovery brought fresh impetus to the search for oil on the Arabian peninsula . </P> <P> Negotiations for an oil concession for al - Hasa province opened at Jeddah in March , 1933 . Twitchell attended with lawyer Lloyd Hamilton on behalf of SOCAL . The Iraq Petroleum Company represented by Stephen Longrigg competed in the bidding but SOCAL was granted the concession on 23 May 1933 . Under the agreement , SOCAL was given `` exploration rights to some 930,000 square kilometers of land for 60 years '' . Soon after the agreement , geologists arrived in al - Hasa and the search for oil was underway . </P> <H2> After discovery of oil ( edit ) </H2> <P> SOCAL set up a subsidiary company , the California Arabian Standard Oil Company ( CASOC ) to develop the oil concession . SOCAL also joined forces with the Texas Oil Company when together they formed CALTEX in 1936 to take advantage of the latter 's formidable marketing network in Africa and Asia . </P> <P> When CASOC geologists surveyed the concession area , they identified a promising site and named it Dammam No. 7 , after a nearby village . Over the next three years , the drillers were unsuccessful in making a commercial strike , but chief geologist Max Steineke persevered . He urged the team to drill deeper , even when Dammam No. 7 was plagued by cave - ins , stuck drill bits and other problems , before the drillers finally struck oil on 3 March 1938 . This discovery would turn out to be first of many , eventually revealing the largest source of crude oil in the world . For the king , oil revenues became a crucial source of wealth since he no longer had to rely on receipts from pilgrimages to Mecca . This discovery would alter Middle Eastern political relations forever . </P> <H2> Changes to the original concession ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1943 , the name of the company in control in Saudi Arabia was changed to Arabian American Oil Company ( ARAMCO ) . In addition , numerous changes were made to the original concession after the striking of oil . In 1939 , the first modification gave the Arabian American Oil Company a greater area to search for oil and extended the concession until 1949 , increasing the original deal by six years . In return , ARAMCO agreed to provide the Saudi Arabian government with large amounts of free kerosene and gasoline , and to pay higher payments than originally stipulated . </P> <P> Beginning in 1950 , the Saudi Arabian government began a pattern of trying to increase government shares of revenue from oil production . In 1950 , a fifty - fifty profit - sharing agreement was signed , whereby a tax was levied by the government . This tax considerably increased government revenues . The government continued this trend well into the ' 80s . By 1982 , ARAMCO 's concession area was reduced to 220,000 square kilometers , down from the original 930,000 square kilometers . By 1988 , ARAMCO was officially bought out by Saudi Arabia and became known as Saudi Aramco . </P> <H2> Tapline ( edit ) </H2> <P> Due to the quantity of the oil in Saudi Arabia , construction of pipelines became necessary to increase efficiency of production and transport . ARAMCO soon realized that `` advantages of a pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea seemed obvious , saving about 3,200 kilometers of sea travel and the transit fees of the Suez Canal '' . In 1945 , the Trans - Arabian Pipeline Company ( Tapline ) was started and was completed in 1950 . The pipeline greatly increased efficiency of oil transport , but also had its shortcomings . Issues concerning taxes and damages plagued it for years . It had to be shut down numerous times for repairs , and by 1983 was officially shut down . </P> <H2> 1973 Arab - Israeli War ( edit ) </H2> <P> This conflict was also known as the Yom Kippur War . This was a conflict between Egypt , Syria and their backers versus Israel . The conflict was the continuation of a troubling historical pattern of conflict between Israel and the Arab world . Because the United States was a supporter of Israel , the Arab countries participated in an oil boycott of Canada , Japan , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom , and the United States . This boycott later includes Portugal , Rhodesia , and South Africa . This was one of the major causes of the 1973 energy crisis that occurred in the United States . After the completion of the war , the price of oil increased drastically allowing Saudi Arabia to gain much wealth and power . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Energy portal </Li> <Li> Saudi Arabia portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia </Li> <Li> Energy in Saudi Arabia </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Saudi Aramco World : Prelude to Discovery '' . saudiaramcoworld.com . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Morton , Michael Quentin ( 2006 ) .
