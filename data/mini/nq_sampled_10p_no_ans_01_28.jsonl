Her father , a Yorkshire police officer , was stationed there at the time . She has one younger brother , Tim . The family moved to Somerset when she was five , and then to Shelley , West Yorkshire , when Headey was 11 . As a child , she took ballet lessons , before being told to stop . </P> <P> Headey had her first experience of acting when she was a pupil at Shelley College ; she was noticed at age 17 , when performing in a school production at the Royal National Theatre , and was picked for a role in the 1992 film Waterland . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1990s : debut and early roles ( edit ) </H3> <P> At the age of 17 , Headey performed in a one - off show and afterwards a casting agent took a photo and asked her to audition . Later , she got a supporting role in the drama Waterland , in which she had the opportunity to work with actors who had been in the business several years before her . She had a small role in The Remains of the Day , which came out in 1993 and received eight Academy Awards nominations . </P> <P> She played Katherine in Disney 's The Jungle Book , released in 1994 . The film had positive reviews and earned nearly $44 million in the United States . Headey , alongside her co-stars received favourable reviews with James Berardinelli praising their `` solid performances '' . On the set of The Jungle Book , she met her boyfriend of nine years , actor Jason Flemyng . </P> <P> After a number of film roles , she appeared opposite Vanessa Redgrave in the 1997 romantic drama Mrs Dalloway . Headey landed a supporting role in a higher - profile film titled Onegin , which starred Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler . The following year , she had the starring role in the drama Aberdeen . Headey received several good reviews for her performance in the film . She also had roles in 2000 's Gossip and 2001 's The Parole Officer . </P> <P> She received the Silver Iris Award for Best Actress at the 2001 Brussels European Film Festival for her role in Aberdeen . In 2002 , she had a role in the mystery drama Possession alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart . </P> <H3> 2000s : Rise to prominence ( edit ) </H3> Headey at the 300 London premiere , 2007 <P> Headey co-starred with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam 's The Brothers Grimm , which was released in August 2005 . The film received mixed reviews . In an interview Headey spoke about her character in the film : `` I loved the fact that she was a tomboy . That is what attracted me to her , that she was n't this predictable female character in this big film . You meet her and she is masking who she is . I loved that her environment dictated who she is . She lives and grows up and survives in the forest . Terry and I talked about how her instincts are almost animalistic and she can see 360 degrees around her . She is aware of what is going on . That is how she is grounded . She is of the earth '' . </P> <P> In 2005 , she starred with actress Piper Perabo in the films The Cave and Imagine Me & You . The Cave was not well received by critics and did poorly at the box office . </P> <P> The romantic comedy - drama Imagine Me & You received a limited release and earned positive reviews . Critics praised Headey 's performance as a lesbian in the film ; Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle stated that the actress `` has a forthright , irresistible appeal and a face and especially a smile that suggest intelligence , integrity and lots of fun '' . </P> <P> Headey played Queen Gorgo in Zack Snyder 's 300 . Headey had to do nude scenes in the film . `` It 's always weird the thought of taking your clothes off in front of 20 people and then to have it projected in front of many more '' , she told IndieLondon during an interview . `` I think it was necessary because we only get that scene to establish their relationship . It is a very obvious moment but I think it does it in quite a beautiful way . '' </P> Headey at the 2007 Scream Awards <P> In addition to her film work , Headey starred in Fox 's Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , a television spin - off of James Cameron 's popular Terminator franchise . Headey played Sarah Connor from January 2008 to April 2009 . The show ran for 31 episodes in two seasons until its cancellation in May 2009 . Variety praised `` Headey 's gritty performance as Sarah -- managing to be smart , resourceful and tough , yet melancholy and vulnerable as well '' and that the Chronicles `` continue to deliver '' , getting `` considerable mileage out of the constant peril '' facing the characters . She was nominated twice for the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television for the role . </P> <P> Headey has also appeared in a number of independent films , such as The Red Baron , a biographical film of the legendary World War I fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen , in which she appeared alongside Matthias Schweighöfer and Joseph Fiennes . Her character was the love interest Käte Otersdorf , a nurse who may or may not have had a romance with Richthofen in real life . She also appeared as the stuffy Miss Dickinson in the 2007 release of the St. Trinian 's series . She starred in the Ridley Scott produced Tell - Tale , a film based on the short story `` The Tell - Tale Heart '' by Edgar Allan Poe . The movie went straight to DVD on 25 May 2008 . </P> <P> In 2008 , Headey starred in the horror film The Broken . The film was directed by Academy Award - nominated Sean Ellis . The film was about `` a woman who suspects she 's being followed around London by a murderous doppelganger '' . The Broken was screened at the midnight portion of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival , and generally got average reviews . Some critics praised Headey 's performance , including Kim Koynar of Cinematical who wrote that Headey `` largely carries the film , and does so quite ably '' . </P> <P> Headey was cast in the lead part in another horror film titled Laid to Rest , which was first screened in 2008 . However , the film went straight to video on 21 April 2009 and earned mixed reviews . Critic Mark H. Harris for About.com stated that the film `` has a great look and boasts an impressive cast , '' referring to both Headey and co-star Thomas Dekker . Headey had a part in a short film called The Devil 's Wedding . She provided her voice for an episode of the Cartoon Network TV series The Super Hero Squad Show playing Black Widow and Mystique . </P> <H3> 2010s : mainstream success ( edit ) </H3> <P> Since its premiere in April 2011 , Headey has portrayed queen regent Cersei Lannister on the HBO series Game of Thrones , based on George R.R.

In July 2015 , it was reported that Headey would voice Jeopardy Mouse in Danger Mouse , a reboot of the 1981 TV series of the same name , which was broadcast on CBBC in late 2015 . Headey stated that `` I wanted to do it because it was pure nostalgia for me . I have children now and it 's just a treat to be involved in something that you loved as a kid and be able to share it . Those moments as an actor that come along once in a while are not to be missed . '' She appeared alongside Alexander Armstrong as Danger Mouse and Stephen Fry as Colonel K . </P> <P> In 2016 , Headey co-starred in the horror film Pride and Prejudice and Zombies , opposite her former Game of Thrones , Century and The Contractor co-star Charles Dance . </P> <P> In 2017 , Headey provided the voiceover for Mercedes A-Class television advertisement . </P> <H2> Public image ( edit ) </H2> <P> She has appeared on the covers of TV Guide , G3 , Sunday Mirror and Germany 's Filmstar .

The divorce was finalised on 26 December 2013 . </P> <P> She was linked to Game of Thrones co-star Jerome Flynn ; however , the relationship reportedly ended badly some time before March 2014 , resulting in the two being kept apart on set . </P> <P> On 10 July 2015 , she gave birth to her second child , a daughter named Teddy , with director Dan Cadan ( her childhood friend , who also worked with Lena on his short film The Devil 's Wedding ) .
