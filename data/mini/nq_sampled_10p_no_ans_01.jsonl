{"document_text": "Echo ( command ) - wikipedia <H1> Echo ( command ) </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> In computing , echo is a command in DOS , OS / 2 , Microsoft Windows , Unix and Unix - like operating systems that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments . It is a command typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file , or as a source part of a pipeline . </P> <P> Many shells , including all Bourne - like ( such as Bash or zsh , ) and Csh - like shells implement echo as a builtin command . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Usage example </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> echo began within Multics , and became part of Version 2 Unix . echo - n in Version 7 replaced prompt , ( which behaved like echo but without terminating its output with a line delimiter ) . </P> <P> On PWB / UNIX and later Unix System III , echo started expanding C escape sequences such as \\ n with the notable difference that octal escape sequences were expressed as \\ 0ooo instead of \\ ooo in C . </P> <P> Eighth Edition Unix echo only did the escape expansion when passed a - e option , and that behaviour was copied by a few other implementations such as the builtin echo command of Bash or zsh and GNU echo . </P> <P> Nowadays , several incompatible implementations of echo exist on different operating systems ( often several on the same system ) , some of them expanding escape sequences by default , some of them not , some of them accepting options ( the list of which varying with implementations ) , some of them not . </P> <P> The POSIX Specification of echo leaves the behaviour unspecified if the first argument is - n or any argument contain backslash characters while the Unix specification ( XSI option in POSIX ) mandates the expansion of ( some ) sequences and does not allow any option processing .

{"document_text": "Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials - wikipedia <H1> Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials </H1> Jump to : navigation , search See also : List of Confederate monuments and memorials and Monument and memorial controversies in the United States The Robert E. Lee monument in New Orleans being lowered , May 19 , 2017 <P> In the wake of the Charleston church shooting in June 2015 , several municipalities in the United States removed monuments and memorials dedicated to the Confederate States of America . The momentum accelerated in August 2017 after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , Virginia . The removals were driven by the belief that the monuments glorify white supremacy and memorialize a government whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of slavery . Many of those who object to the removals claim that the artifacts are part of the cultural heritage of the United States . </P> <P> The vast majority of these Confederate monuments were built during the Jim Crow Era ( 1877 - 1954 ) and the African - American Civil Rights Movement ( 1954 -- 1968 ) era as a means of intimidating African Americans and reaffirming white supremacy . The monuments have thus become highly politicized ; according to Eleanor Harvey , a senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and a scholar of Civil War history : `` If white nationalists and neo-Nazis are now claiming this as part of their heritage , they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again '' . According to Stan Deaton , senior historian at the Georgia Historical Society , `` These laws are the Old South imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more . This is what led to the Civil War , and it still divides us as a country . We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past .

These two periods also coincided with the 50th anniversary and the American Civil War Centennial . The peak in construction of Civil War Monuments occurred between the late 1890s up to 1920 , with a second , smaller peak in the late 1950s to mid 1960s . </P> <P> According to historian Jane Dailey from University of Chicago , in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a `` white supremacist future '' . Another historian , Karyn Cox , from University of North Carolina has written that the monuments are `` a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era '' . Another historian from UNC , James Leloudis , stated that `` The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule . '' </P> <P> Adam Goodheart , Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at Washington College , stated in National Geographic : `` They 're 20th - century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners , but importantly still excluded black people . '' </P> <H2> Academic commentary ( edit ) </H2> <P> In an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy , the American Historical Association ( AHA ) said that to remove a monument `` is not to erase history , but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history . '' The AHA noted that most monuments were erected `` without anything resembling a democratic process , '' and recommended that it was `` time to reconsider these decisions . '' According to the AHA , most Confederate monuments were erected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , and this undertaking was `` part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South . '' According to the AHA , memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period `` were intended , in part , to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction , and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life . '' A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement , and according to the AHA `` these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes . '' </P> <P> According to historian Adam Goodheart , the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise . Elijah Anderson , a professor of sociology at Yale University , said the statues `` really impacts the psyche of black people . '' Harold Holzer , the director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College , agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans . Dell Upton , chair of the Department of Art History at the University of California , Los Angeles , wrote that `` the monuments were not intended as public art , '' but rather were installed `` as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity , '' and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent , their removal from civic spaces was a matter `` of justice , equity , and civic values . '' In a 1993 book , author Frank McKenney argued otherwise ; `` These monuments were communal efforts , public art , and social history , '' he wrote . Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women , the `` mothers widows , and orphans , the bereaved fiancees and sisters '' of the soldiers who had lost their lives . Many ladies memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War , most of them joining the United Daughters of the Confederacy following its inception in 1894 . The women were advised to `` remember that they were buying art , not metal and stone ; '' The history the monuments celebrated told only one side of the story , however -- one that was `` openly pro-Confederate , '' Upton argues . Furthermore , Confederate monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African - Americans , who remembered the Civil War far differently , and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved . According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg , professor of history at Villanova University , `` White supremacy is really what these statues represent . '' </P> <P> Robert Seigler in his study of Confederate monuments in South Carolina found that out of the over one hundred and seventy that he documented , only five monuments were found dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy working `` on fortifications , and had served as musicians , teamsters , cooks , servants , and in other capacities , '' four of those were to slaves and one to a musician , Henry Brown . </P> <P> Eric Foner , a historian of the Civil War and biographer of Lincoln , argued that more statues of African - Americans like Nat Turner should be constructed . Alfred Brophy , a professor of law at the University of Alabama , argued the removal of the Confederate statues `` facilitates forgetting '' , although these statues were `` re-inscribed images of white supremacy '' . Brophy also stated that the Lee statue in Charlottesville should be removed . </P> <H2> History of removals ( edit ) </H2> Planned removal of the Robert Edward Lee Sculpture in Charlottesville , Va. sparked protests and counter-protests , resulting in three deaths . <P> The removals were marked by events in Louisiana and Virginia within the span of two years . In Louisiana , after the Charleston church shooting of 2015 , the city of New Orleans removed its Confederate memorials two years later . A few months later , in August 2017 , a state of emergency was declared in Virginia after a Unite the Right rally against the removal of the Robert Edward Lee statue in Charlottesville turned violent . </P> <P> Other events followed across the United States . In Baltimore , for example , the city 's Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15 -- 16 , 2017 . Mayor Catherine Pugh said that she ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety . Similarly , in Lexington , Kentucky , Mayor Jim Gray asked the city council on August 16 , 2017 to approve the relocation of two statues from a courthouse . A different event occurred in Durham , North Carolina , where several protesters toppled the Confederate Soldiers Monument outside the Old Durham County Courthouse on August 15 , 2017 . Eight activists were arrested in connection with the illegal action . </P> <H2> Laws prohibiting removals ( edit ) </H2> <P> In Alabama ( 2017 ) , Mississippi ( 2004 ) , North Carolina ( 2015 ) , South Carolina ( 2000 ) , Tennessee ( 2016 ) , and Virginia ( 1902 ) , state laws prohibit the removal or alteration of monuments . Attempts to repeal these laws have not yet ( 2017 ) been successful . Alabama 's law , the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act , was passed in May 2017 , North Carolina 's law in 2015 . Tennessee passed its Tennessee Heritage Protection Act in 2016 . </P> <P> The removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a 2 / 3 vote of both houses of the legislature . </P> <P> A 2017 Reuters poll found that 54 % of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces , and 27 % said they should be removed , while 19 % said they were unsure . The results were split along racial and political lines , with Republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place , while Democrats and minorities preferring their removal . Another 207 poll , by HuffPost / YouGov , found that 33 % of respondents favored removal while 48 % were opposed , with roughly 18 % unsure about removal . </P> <H2> Removed monuments and memorials ( edit ) </H2> <H2> Alabama ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Birmingham <Ul> <Li> In August 2017 , immediately after William A. Bell , the mayor of Birmingham , draped a Confederate memorial with plastic and surrounded it with plywood with the rationale `` This country should in no way tolerate the hate that the KKK ( Ku Klux Klan ) , neo-Nazis , fascists and other hate groups spew '' , Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued Bell and the city for violating a new ( 2017 ) state law that prohibits the `` relocation , removal , alteration , or other disturbance of any monument on public property that has been in place for 40 years or more '' . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Demopolis <Ul> <Li> Confederate Park . Renamed `` Confederate Park '' in 1923 at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy . A Confederate soldier statue was erected in 1910 at the intersection of North Main Avenue and West Capital Street adjacent to the Park . It was destroyed on July 16 , 2016 , when a policeman accidentally crashed his patrol car into the monument . The statue fell from its pedestal and was heavily damaged . In 2017 , Demopolis city government voted 3 -- 2 to move the damaged Confederate statue to a local museum and to install a new obelisk memorial that honors both the Union and the Confederate soldiers . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H2> Arizona ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Fort Breckinridge : Named for John C.

( New provisions effective 2011 Jul 01 . ) </P> <H2> Carrying handguns ( edit ) </H2> <P> Indiana requires a license for most methods of carrying a handgun . Indiana laws are silent concerning the manner of carry ; therefore , the laws cover open carry , concealed carry , vehicle carry , and locked case carry . There are exceptions for carrying a handgun unloaded , not readily accessible , and secured in a case in a vehicle , on your own property , from place of purchase and to a firearm range for the purpose of practice . </P> <P> Indiana is a `` shall issue '' state for the License To Carry a Handgun . A license to carry will be issued to individuals age 18 or older who meet a number of legal requirements . Currently both limited term and unlimited lifetime licenses are available . </P> <P> Grounds for disqualification include a conviction for a felony or for misdemeanor domestic battery . A license can also be denied if the applicant has been arrested for a violent crime and `` a court has found probable cause to believe that the person committed the offense charged '' . Documented substance abuse within a certain time frame is a disqualifier , as is documented evidence of any given person 's `` propensity for violent or emotionally unstable conduct . '' </P> <P> Indiana residents , or non-residents with a `` regular place of business '' in Indiana , must obtain an Indiana license . Application for a license must be made to the local police department , or absent that , to the county police department . Four - year and lifetime permits are issued for Indiana residents . Out - of - state residents may only be issued four - year permits , minus Active Duty Military who become stationed in Indiana . Active Duty military stationed in Indiana can apply for lifetime permits through their local city or county police department . </P> <P> Indiana law stands mute vis - à - vis long gun carry . There are some Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) rules , but these only apply on DNR properties or to hunters . Generally speaking , possession of long guns is legal whether the gun is either on one 's person or in one 's motor vehicle , loaded or not , concealed or not . There are additional rules regarding firearms possession on ATVs and snowmobiles . </P> <H2> Restricted locations ( edit ) </H2> <P> It is illegal to carry a concealed weapon , even sporting arms , on school property ( K - 12 and day care ) or on a school bus , Lawful gun owners may have guns in their vehicles on school property provided the gun is stored out of plain sight in the person 's locked motor vehicle or that the driver is only transporting someone to , or from , a school event . It is also illegal to carry on a commercial airplane or in the controlled section of an airport , on a riverboat gambling cruise , at the Indiana State Fair , courthouses and the Indiana Statehouse and Government Center . Carrying on Army Corps of Engineers property which include Brookville Lake , Cagles Mill Lake , Cecil M. Harden Lake , J. Edward Roush Lake , Mississinewa Lake , Monroe Lake , Patoka Lake , and Salamonie Lake is restricted according to CFR Title 36 , Chapter 111 , Part 327 . </P> <P> Private businesses may restrict or forbid firearms on their properties . However , a 2010 law prohibits employers from discharging employees for in - vehicle firearms possession on business property . Furthermore , an employer may not ask any employee about the possession of firearms and / or ammunition . </P> <H2> Ownership and purchase ( edit ) </H2> <P> Firearms dealers or private individuals may not sell any firearm to someone less than 18 years old , or less than 23 years old if the buyer was `` adjudicated a delinquent child for an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult '' , or to a person who is mentally incompetent or is a drug or alcohol abuser . </P> <P> All NFA - regulated weapons and devices are legal in Indiana . </P> <H2> Reciprocity ( edit ) </H2> <P> Indiana honors all other states handgun licenses , though not all other states honor Indiana 's license . Because there is no obligation for one state to notify another state of any change in their gun laws the Indiana State Police does not attempt to track this information . An Illinois Firearms Owners Identification ( FOID ) card allows Illinois residents to purchase and possess firearms and ammunition . The FOID is not a permit to carry a handgun , therefore it is not honored as such by Indiana , but the Illinois license to carry a concealed firearm , first issued in February 2014 , is honored like that of any other state . </P> <P> The following states have established arrangements where they recognize or honor permits or licenses issued by the State of Indiana : Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Idaho , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , New Hampshire , North Carolina , North Dakota , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Vermont , Wisconsin , and Wyoming . </P> <H2> Firearm ( handgun ) license Statistics ( edit ) </H2> <P> In January 2013 , the Indiana State Police Firearms Section began publishing quarterly reports that show the number of active handgun licenses held by Indiana residents . As of December 31 , 2015 , there were 661,334 active licenses to carry firearms issued by Indiana , with 23.8 % being issued to females . In 2015 , 5.4 % of all applicants were rejected for various reasons , 15.5 % of rejected applicants being female . </P> <H2> Loss of firearm rights ( edit ) </H2> <P> Both Indiana and Federal laws restrict purchase and possession under certain circumstances . Federal law prohibits possession of firearms for life by those convicted of felonies and for those convicted of misdemeanors involving domestic violence . Indiana law prohibits as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 2 - 1 prohibits carrying handguns or possession within dwelling by those convicted of domestic battery . </Li> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 4 - 6 states that it is a Class A misdemeanor for a person convicted of domestic battery to possess a firearm . </Li> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 2 - 7 prohibits transfer or sale of firearms to any person with a felony conviction . </Li> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 4 - 5 prohibits possession of firearms for convictions of `` serious violent felonies '' . </Li> </Ul> <P> While Indiana law mirrors federal law for the most part , it does not ban those with non-violent felonies from possession of firearms . Therefore , a person with a non-violent felony in Indiana would be allowed to possess a firearm under Indiana law , but because federal law prohibits possession in this instance , that person would be unable to purchase a firearm since purchasing a firearm is subject to federal law and a NICS background check . </P> <H2> Restoration of firearm rights ( edit ) </H2> <P> Because firearm rights are governed by state and federal law , whether someone can restore those rights can be a tricky question even for an attorney to answer . In some circumstances a person might be able to restore their Indiana rights while not fully restoring their federal rights . </P> <P> For those barred from possession because of a conviction for domestic battery , Indiana Code § 35 - 47 - 4 - 7 allows one to petition the court for restoration of the right after 5 years from the date of conviction . </P> <P> Restoration of rights for those convicted of felonies is usually barred by federal law . This arises because federal law does not recognize expungements as restoring firearm rights if the expungement does not fully satisfy federal law by fully sealing the conviction so that it can not be used in subsequent proceedings . Therefore , while an Indiana expungement restores civil rights ( except for domestic battery , which requires a separate petition ) , it does not restore one 's federal rights . The only exception is for non-violent Class D felony convictions . Because Indiana law allows those with non-violent Class D felony convictions to petition the court to reduce the felony to a Class A misdemeanor , unless a person was barred by other convictions , a successful reduction will restore a person 's rights under federal and state law . </P> <H2> Other laws ( edit ) </H2> <P> Cartridges that `` can be fired in a handgun '' that have `` a projectile that has a metal core and an outer coating of plastic '' are prohibited . `` This section does not apply to nylon coated ammunition , plastic shot capsules , or ammunition designed to be used in rifles or shotguns . '' </P> <P> Indiana provides lawsuit protection to law - abiding manufacturers , sellers , and trade associations for the misuse of firearms by third parties . Lawsuits are permitted for cases of damage or injury caused by defective firearms or ammunition , or breach of contract or warranty . </P> <P> Indiana 's law about self - defense ( and the defense of others ) can be found at Indiana Code , Title 35 , Article 41 , Chapter 3 -- 2 . </P> <P> Suppressors are legal in the state of Indiana with the correct provisions and tax stamps to the correct federal entities and may be used for hunting . </P> <P> The information in this article is either directly stated ( or inferred ) from Indiana Code , Title 35 , Article 47 , Chapters 1 -- 14 , Title 34 , Article 28 , Chapter 7 and Title 34 , Article 12 , Chapter 3 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ NRA - ILA . `` NRA - ILA Indiana : 2017 Legislative Session Adjourns '' .

{"document_text": "Dog behavior - wikipedia <H1> Dog behavior </H1> A drawing by Konrad Lorenz showing facial expressions of a dog - a communication behavior <P> Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses of individuals or groups of domestic dogs to internal and external stimuli . It has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans and their lifestyles . As a result of this physical and social evolution , dogs , more than any other species , have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to their behaviors .

Whole genome sequencing indicates that the dog , the gray wolf and the extinct Taymyr wolf diverged at around the same time 27,000 - 40,000 years ago . How dogs became domesticated is not clear , however the two main hypotheses are self - domestication or human domestication . There exists evidence of human - canine coevolution . </P> <H2> Intelligence ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog intelligence <P> Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems . Dogs have been shown to learn by inference . A study with Rico showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items . He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure . Dogs have advanced memory skills . A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie , `` Chaser '' , who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words . Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing , and to understand human voice commands . After undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task , dogs that are faced with an insolvable version of the same problem look at the human , while socialized wolves do not . Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception . </P> <H2> Senses ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog anatomy § Senses <P> The dog 's senses include vision , hearing , sense of smell , taste , touch and sensitivity to the earth 's magnetic field . </P> <H2> Communication behavior ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog communication <P> Dog communication is about how dogs `` speak '' to each other , how they understand messages that humans send to them , and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit . These communication behaviors include eye gaze , facial expression , vocalization , body posture ( including movements of bodies and limbs ) and gustatory communication ( scents , pheromones and taste ) . Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization , hand signals and body posture . </P> <H2> Social behavior ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two studies have indicated that dog behavior varied with their size , body weight and skull size . </P> <H3> Play ( edit ) </H3> Dog - dog ( edit ) Dog playing with a guinea pig . <P> Play between dogs usually involves several behaviours that are often seen in aggressive encounters , for example , nipping , biting and growling . It is therefore important for the dogs to place these behaviours in the context of play , rather than aggression . Dogs signal their intent to play with a range of behaviours including a `` play - bow '' , `` face - pawed '' `` open - mouthed play face '' and postures inviting the other dog to chase the initiator . Similar signals are given throughout the play bout to maintain the context of the potentially aggressive activities . </P> <P> From a young age , dogs engage in play with one another . Dog play is made up primarily of mock fights . It is believed that this behavior , which is most common in puppies , is training for important behaviors later in life . Play between puppies is not necessarily a 50 : 50 symmetry of dominant and submissive roles between the individuals ; dogs who engage in greater rates of dominant behaviours ( e.g. chasing , forcing partners down ) at later ages also initiate play at higher rates . This could imply that winning during play becomes more important as puppies mature . </P> <P> Emotional contagion is linked to facial mimicry in humans and primates . Facial mimicry is an automatic response that occurs in less than 1 second in which one person involuntary mimics another person 's facial expressions , forming empathy . It has also been found in dogs at play , and play sessions lasted longer when there were facial mimicry signals from one dog to another . </P> Dog - human ( edit ) <P> The motivation for a dog to play with another dog is distinct from that of a dog playing with a human . Dogs walked together with opportunities to play with one another , play with their owners with the same frequency as dogs being walked alone . Dogs in households with two or more dogs play more often with their owners than dogs in households with a single dog , indicating the motivation to play with other dogs does not substitute for the motivation to play with humans . </P> <P> It is a common misconception that winning and losing games such as `` tug - of - war '' and `` rough - and - tumble '' can influence a dog 's dominance relationship with humans . Rather , the way in which dogs play indicates their temperament and relationship with their owner . Dogs that play rough - and - tumble are more amenable and show lower separation anxiety than dogs which play other types of games , and dogs playing tug - of - war and `` fetch '' are more confident . Dogs which start the majority of games are less amenable and more likely to be aggressive . </P> <P> Playing with humans can affect the cortisol levels of dogs . In one study , the cortisol responses of police dogs and border guard dogs was assessed after playing with their handlers . The cortisol concentrations of the police dogs increased , whereas the border guard dogs ' hormone levels decreased . The researchers noted that during the play sessions , police officers were disciplining their dogs , whereas the border guards were truly playing with them , i.e. this included bonding and affectionate behaviours . They commented that several studies have shown that behaviours associated with control , authority or aggression increase cortisol , whereas play and affiliative behaviour decrease cortisol levels . </P> <H3> Empathy ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2012 , a study found that dogs oriented toward their owner or a stranger more often when the person was pretending to cry than when they were talking or humming . When the stranger pretended to cry , rather than approaching their usual source of comfort , their owner , dogs sniffed , nuzzled and licked the stranger instead . The dogs ' pattern of response was behaviorally consistent with an expression of empathic concern . </P> <P> A study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when separated from others . </P> <H3> Personalities ( edit ) </H3> <P> The term personality has been applied to human research , whereas the term temperament has been mostly used for animal research . However , both terms have been used interchangeably in the literature , or purely to distinguish humans from animals and avoid anthropomorphism . Personality can be defined by `` a set of behaviours that are consistent over context and time '' . Human personality is often studied using models that look at broad dimensions of personality . For example , the Five Factor Model is one of the most commonly used models , and the most extensively studied . It is composed of five dimensions : openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism . Studies of dog personality have also tried to identify the presence of broad personality traits that are stable over time . Recently , dog 's personality dimension has been shown to be relatively consistent over time . </P> <P> There are different approaches to assess dog personality : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Ratings of individual dogs : either a caretaker or a dog expert who is familiar with the dog is asked to answer a questionnaire , for instance the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire , concerning how often the dog show certain type of behaviour . </Li> <Li> Tests : the dog is submitted to a set of tests and its reactions are evaluated on a behavioural scale . For instance , the dog is presented to a familiar and then an unfamiliar person in order to measure sociability or aggression . </Li> <Li> Observational test : The dog 's behaviour is evaluated in a selected but not controlled environment . An observer focus on the dog 's reactions to naturally occurring stimuli . For example a walk through the supermarket can allow the observer to see the dog in various types of conditions ( crowd , loud noise ... ) . </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Several potential personality traits have been identified in dogs , for instance `` Playfulness '' , `` Curiosity / Fearlessness , `` Chase - proneness '' , `` Sociability and Aggressiveness '' and `` Shyness -- Boldness '' . A meta - analysis of 51 published peer reviewed articles identified seven dimension of canine personality : </P> <Ol> <Li> Reactivity ( approach or avoidance of new objects , increased activity in novel situations ) </Li> <Li> Fearfulness ( shaking , avoiding novel situations ) </Li> <Li> Activity </Li> <Li> Sociability ( initiating friendly interactions with people and other dogs ) </Li> <Li> Responsiveness to Training ( working with people , learning quickly ) </Li> <Li> Submissiveness </Li> <Li> Aggression </Li> </Ol> <P> Dog Breed plays an important role in the dog 's personality dimensions , while the effects of age and sex have not been clearly determined . Dogs personality models can be used for a range of tasks , including guide and working dog selection , finding appropriate families to re-home shelter dogs , or selecting breeding stock . </P> <H3> Leadership , dominance and social groups ( edit ) </H3> Two dogs playing follow the leader . <P> Dominance is a descriptive term for the relationship between pairs of individuals . Among ethologists , dominance has been defined as ' ' an attribute of the pattern of repeated , antagonistic interactions between two individuals , characterized by a consistent outcome in favor of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation . The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser subordinate . ' ' Another definition is that a dominant animal has priority of access to resources . Dominance is a relative attribute , not absolute ; there is no reason to assume that a high - ranking individual in one group would also become high ranking if moved to another . Nor is there any good evidence that ' ' dominance ' ' is a lifelong character trait . Competitive behavior characterized by confident ( e.g. growl , inhibited bite , stand over , stare at , chase , bark at ) and submissive ( e.g. crouch , avoid , displacement lick / yawn , run away ) patterns exchanged . </P> <P> One test to ascertain in which group the dominant dog was used the following criteria : When a stranger comes to the house , which dog starts to bark first or if they start to bark together , which dog barks more or longer ? Which dog licks more often the other dog 's mouth ? If the dogs get food at the same time and at the same spot , which dog starts to eat first or eats the other dog 's food ? If the dogs start to fight , which dog usually wins ? </P> <P> Domestic dogs appear to pay little attention to relative size , despite the large weight differences between the largest and smallest individuals ; for example , size was not a predictor of the outcome of encounters between dogs meeting while being exercised by their owners nor was size correlated with neutered male dogs . Therefore , many dogs do not appear to pay much attention to the actual fighting ability of their opponent , presumably allowing differences in motivation ( how much the dog values the resource ) and perceived motivation ( what the behavior of the other dog signifies about the likelihood that it will escalate ) to play a much greater role . </P> <P> Two dogs that are contesting possession of a highly valued resource for the first time , if one is in a state of emotional arousal , in pain ; if reactivity is influenced by recent endocrine changes , or motivational states such as hunger , then the outcome of the interaction may be different than if none of these factors were present . Equally , the threshold at which aggression is shown may be influenced by a range of medical factors , or , in some cases , precipitated entirely by pathological disorders . Hence , the contextual and physiological factors present when two dogs first encounter each other may profoundly influence the long - term nature of the relationship between those dogs . The complexity of the factors involved in this type of learning means that dogs may develop different ' ' expectations ' ' about the likely response of another individual for each resource in a range of different situations . Puppies learn early not to challenge an older dog and this respect stays with them into adulthood . When adult animals meet for the first time , they have no expectations of the behavior of the other : they will both , therefore , be initially anxious and vigilant in this encounter ( characterized by the tense body posture and sudden movements typically seen when two dogs first meet ) , until they start to be able to predict the responses of the other individual . The outcome of these early adult -- adult interactions will be influenced by the specific factors present at the time of the initial encounters . As well as contextual and physiological factors , the previous experiences of each member of the dyad of other dogs will also influence their behavior . </P> <H3> Scent ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dogs have an olfactory sense 40 times more sensitive than a human 's and they commence their lives operating almost exclusively on smell and touch . The special scents that dogs use for communication are called pheromones . Different hormones are secreted when a dog is angry , fearful or confident , and some chemical signatures identify the sex and age of the dog , and if a female is in the estrus cycle , pregnant or recently given birth . Many of the pheromone chemicals can be found dissolved in a dog 's urine , and sniffing where another dog has urinated gives the dog a great deal of information about that dog . Male dogs prefer to mark vertical surfaces and having the scent higher allows the air to carry it farther . The height of the marking tells other dogs about the size of the dog , as among canines size is an important factor in dominance . </P> <P> Dogs ( and wolves ) mark their territories with urine and their stools . The anal gland of canines give a particular signature to fecal deposits and identifies the marker as well as the place where the dung is left . Dogs are very particular about these landmarks , and engage in what is to humans a meaningless and complex ritual before defecating . Most dogs start with a careful bout of sniffing of a location , perhaps to erect an exact line or boundary between their territory and another dog 's territory . This behavior may also involve a small degree of elevation , such as a rock or fallen branch , to aid scent dispersal . Scratching the ground after defecating is a visual sign pointing to the scent marking . The freshness of the scent gives visitors some idea of the current status of a piece of territory and if it is used frequently . Regions under dispute , or used by different animals at different times , may lead to marking battles with every scent marked - over by a new competitor . </P> Further information : Dog communication <H3> Feral dogs ( edit ) </H3> <P> Feral dogs are those dogs living in a wild state with no food and shelter intentionally provided by humans , and showing a continuous and strong avoidance of direct human contacts . In the developing world pet dogs are uncommon , but feral , village or community dogs are plentiful around humans . The distinction between feral , stray , and free ranging dogs is sometimes a matter of degree , and a dog may shift its status throughout its life . In some unlikely but observed cases , a feral dog that was not born wild but living with a feral group can become rehabilitated to a domestic dog with an owner . A dog can become a stray when it escapes human control , by abandonment or being born to a stray mother . A stray dog can become feral when forced out of the human environment or when co-opted or socially accepted by a nearby feral group . Feralization occurs through the development of a fear response to humans . </P> <P> Feral dogs are not reproductively self - sustaining , suffer from high rates of juvenile mortality , and depend indirectly on humans for their food , their space , and the supply of co-optable individuals . </P> <P> See further : behavior compared to other canids . </P> <H3> Other behavior ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dogs have a general behavioral trait of strongly preferring novelty ( `` neophillia '' ) compared to familiarity . The average sleep time of a dog in captivity in a 24 - hour period is 10.1 hours . </P> <H2> Reproduction behavior ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Canine reproduction <H3> Estrous cycle and mating ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although puppies do not have the urge to procreate , males sometimes engage in sexual play in the form of mounting . In some puppies , this behavior occurs as early as 3 or 4 weeks - of - age . </P> <P> Dogs reach sexual maturity and can reproduce during their first year , in contrast to wolves at two years - of - age . Female dogs have their first estrus ( `` heat '' ) at 6 to 12 months - of - age ; smaller dogs tend to come into heat earlier whereas larger dogs take longer to mature . </P> <P> Female dogs have an estrous cycle that is nonseasonal and monestrus , i.e. there is only one estrus per estrous cycle . The interval between one estrus and another is , on average , seven months , however , this may range between 4 and 12 months . This interestrous period is not influenced by the photoperiod or pregnancy . The average duration of estrus is 9 days with spontaneous ovulation usually about 3 days after the onset of estrus . </P> <P> For several days before estrus , a phase called proestrus , the female dog may show greater interest in male dogs and `` flirt '' with them ( proceptive behavior ) . There is progressive vulval swelling and some bleeding . If males try to mount a female dog during proestrus , she may avoid mating by sitting down or turning round and growling or snapping . </P> <P> Estrous behavior in the female dog is usually indicated by her standing still with the tail held up , or to the side of the perineum , when the male sniffs the vulva and attempts to mount . This tail position is sometimes called `` flagging '' . The female dog may also turn , presenting the vulva to the male . </P> <P> The male dog mounts the female and is able to achieve intromission with a non-erect penis , which contains a bone called the os penis . The dog 's penis enlarges inside the vagina , thereby preventing its withdrawal ; this is sometimes known as the `` tie '' or `` copulatory lock '' . The male dog rapidly thrust into the female for 1 -- 2 minutes then dismounts with the erect penis still inside the vagina , and turns to stand rear - end to rear - end with the female dog for up to 30 to 40 minutes ; the penis is twisted 180 degrees in a lateral plane . During this time , prostatic fluid is ejaculated . </P> <P> The female dog can bear another litter within 8 months of the previous one . Dogs are polygamous in contrast to wolves that are generally monogamous . Therefore , dogs have no pair bonding and the protection of a single mate , but rather have multiple mates in a year . The consequence is that wolves put a lot of energy into producing a few pups in contrast to dogs that maximize the production of pups . This higher pup production rate enables dogs to maintain or even increase their population with a lower pup survival rate than wolves , and allows dogs a greater capacity than wolves to grow their population after a population crash or when entering a new habitat . It is proposed that these differences are an alternative breeding strategy , one adapted to a life of scavenging instead of hunting . </P> <H3> Parenting and early life ( edit ) </H3> <P> All of the wild members of the genus Canis display complex coordinated parental behaviors . Wolf pups are cared primarily by their mother for the first 3 months of their life when she remains in the den with them while they rely on her milk for sustenance and her presence for protection . The father brings her food . Once they leave the den and can chew , the parents and pups from previous years regurgitate food for them . Wolf pups become independent by 5 to 8 months , although they often stay with their parents for years . In contrast , dog pups are cared for by the mother and rely on her for milk and protection but she gets no help from the father nor other dogs . Once pups are weaned around 10 weeks they are independent and receive no further maternal care . </P> <H2> Behavior problems ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are many different types of behavioural issues that a dog can exhibit , including growling , snapping , barking , and invading human 's space . A survey of 203 dog owners in Melbourne , Australia , found that the main behaviour problems reported by owners were overexcitement ( 63 % ) and jumping up on people ( 56 % ) . Some problems are related to attachment while others are neurological , as seen below . </P> <H3> Separation anxiety ( edit ) </H3> <P> When dogs are separated from humans , usually the owner , they often display behaviors which can be broken into the following four categories : exploratory behaviour , object play , destructive behaviour , and vocalization , and they are related to the canine 's level of arousal . These behaviours may manifest as destructiveness , fecal or urinary elimination , hypersalivation or vocalization among other things . Dogs from single - owner homes are approximately 2.5 times more likely to have separation anxiety compared to dogs from multiple - owner homes . Furthermore , sexually intact dogs are only one third as likely to have separation anxiety as neutered dogs . The sex of dogs and whether there is another pet in the home do not have an effect on separation anxiety . It has been estimated that at least 14 % of dogs examined at typical veterinary practices in the United States have shown signs of separation anxiety . Dogs that have been diagnosed with profound separation anxiety can be left alone for no more than minutes before they begin to panic and exhibit the behaviors associated with separation anxiety . Separation problems have been found to be linked to the dog 's dependency on its owner , not because of disobedience . In the absence of treatment , affected dogs are often relinquished to a humane society or shelter , abandoned , or euthanized . </P> <H3> Resource guarding ( edit ) </H3> <P> Resource guarding is exhibited by many canines , and is one of the most commonly reported behaviour issues to canine professionals . It is seen when a dog uses specific behaviour patterns so that they can control access to an item , and the patterns are flexible when people are around . If a canine places value on some resource ( i.e. food , toys , etc . ) they may attempt to guard it from other animals as well as people , which leads to behavioural problems if not treated . The guarding can show in many different ways from rapid ingestion of food to using the body to shield items . It manifests as aggressive behaviour including , but not limited to , growling , barking , or snapping . Some dogs will also resource guard their owners and can become aggressive if the behaviour is allowed to continue . Owners must learn to interpret their dog 's body language in order to try to judge the dog 's reaction , as visual signals are used ( i.e. changes in body posture , facial expression , etc . ) to communicate feeling and response . These behaviours are commonly seen in shelter animals , most likely due to insecurities caused by a poor environment . Resource guarding is a concern since it can lead to aggression , but research has found that aggression over guarding can be contained by teaching the dog to drop the item they are guarding . </P> <H3> Noise anxiety ( edit ) </H3> <P> Canines often fear , and exhibit stress responses to , loud noises . Noise - related anxieties in dogs may be triggered by fireworks , thunderstorms , gunshots , and even loud or sharp bird noises . Associated stimuli may also come to trigger the symptoms of the phobia or anxiety , such as a change in barometric pressure being associated with a thunderstorm , thus causing an anticipatory anxiety . </P> <H3> Tail chasing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Tail chasing can be classified as a stereotypy . It falls under obsessive compulsive disorder , which is a neuropsychiatric disorder that can present in dogs as canine compulsive disorder . In one clinical study on this potential behavioral problem , 18 tail - chasing terriers were given clomipramine orally at a dosage of 1 to 2 mg / kg ( 0.5 to 0.9 mg / lb ) of body weight , every 12 hours . Three of the dogs required treatment at a slightly higher dosage range to control tail chasing , however , after 1 to 12 weeks of treatment , 9 of 12 dogs were reported to have a 75 % or greater reduction in tail chasing . Personality can also play a factor in tail chasing . Dogs who chase their tails have been found to be more shy than those who do not , and some dogs also show a lower level of response during tail chasing bouts . </P> <H2> Behavior compared to other canids ( edit ) </H2> <P> Comparisons made within the wolf - like canids allow the identification of those behaviors that may have been inherited from common ancestry and those that may have been the result of domestication or other relatively recent environmental changes . Studies of free - ranging African Basenjis and New Guinea Singing Dogs indicate that their behavioral and ecological traits were the result of environmental selection pressures or selective breeding choices and not the result of artificial selection imposed by humans . </P> <H3> Early aggression ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dog pups show unrestrained fighting with their siblings from 2 weeks of age , with injury avoided only due to their undeveloped jaw muscles . This fighting gives way to play - chasing with the development of running skills at 4 -- 5 weeks . Wolf pups possess more - developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age , when they first show signs of play - fighting with their siblings . Serious fighting occurs during 4 -- 6 weeks of age . Compared to wolf and dog pups , golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4 -- 6 weeks when play - fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm . This aggression ceases by 10 -- 12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed . </P> <H3> Tameness ( edit ) </H3> <P> Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production - related traits , dogs were initially selected for their behaviors . In 2016 , a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs . These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution , and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication . These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway , with the majority of the genes affecting the fight - or - flight response ( i.e. selection for tameness ) , and emotional processing . Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves . Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds , indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation . </P> <H3> Social structure ( edit ) </H3> <P> Among canids , packs are the social units that hunt , rear young and protect a communal territory as a stable group and their members are usually related . Members of the feral dog group are usually not related . Feral dog groups are composed of a stable 2 - 6 members compared to the 2 - 15 member wolf pack whose size fluctuates with the availability of prey and reaches a maximum in winter time . The feral dog group consists of monogamous breeding pairs compared to the one breeding pair of the wolf pack . Agonistic behavior does not extend to the individual level and does not support a higher social structure compared to the ritualized agonistic behavior of the wolf pack that upholds its social structure . Feral pups have a very high mortality rate that adds little to the group size , with studies showing that adults are usually killed through accidents with humans , therefore other dogs need to be co-opted from villages to maintain stable group size . </P> <H3> Socialization ( edit ) </H3> <P> The critical period for socialization begins with walking and exploring the environment . Dog and wolf pups both develop the ability to see , hear and smell at 4 weeks of age . Dogs begin to explore the world around them at 4 weeks of age with these senses available to them , while wolves begin to explore at 2 weeks of age when they have the sense of smell but are functionally blind and deaf . The consequences of this is that more things are novel and frightening to wolf pups . The critical period for socialization closes with the avoidance of novelty , when the animal runs away from - rather than approaching and exploring - novel objects . For dogs this develops between 4 and 8 weeks of age . Wolves reach the end of the critical period after 6 weeks , after which it is not possible to socialize a wolf . </P> <P> Dog puppies require as little as 90 minutes of contact with humans during their critical period of socialization to form a social attachment . This will not create a highly social pet but a dog that will solicit human attention . Wolves require 24 hours contact a day starting before 3 weeks of age . To create a socialized wolf the pups are removed from the den at 10 days of age , kept in constant human contact until they are 4 weeks old when they begin to bite their sleeping human companions , then spend only their waking hours in the presence of humans . This socialization process continues until age 4 months , when the pups can join other captive wolves but will require daily human contact to remain socialized . Despite this intensive socialization process , a well - socialized wolf will behave differently to a well - socialized dog and will display species - typical hunting and reproductive behaviors , only closer to humans than a wild wolf . These wolves do not generalize their socialization to all humans in the same manner as a socialized dog and they remain more fearful of novelty compared to socialized dogs . </P> <P> In 1982 , a study to observe the differences between dogs and wolves raised in similar conditions took place . The dog puppies preferred larger amounts of sleep at the beginning of their lives , while the wolf puppies were much more active . The dog puppies also preferred the company of humans , rather than their canine foster mother , though the wolf puppies were the exact opposite , spending more time with their foster mother . The dogs also showed a greater interest in the food given to them and paid little attention to their surroundings , while the wolf puppies found their surroundings to be much more intriguing than their food or food bowl . The wolf puppies were observed taking part in antagonistic play at a younger age , while the dog puppies did not display dominant / submissive roles until they were much older . The wolf puppies were rarely seen as being aggressive to each other or towards the other canines . On the other hand , the dog puppies were much more aggressive to each other and other canines , often seen full - on attacking their foster mother or one another . </P> <H3> Cognition ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite claims that dogs show more human - like social cognition than wolves , several recent studies have demonstrated that if wolves are properly socialized to humans and have the opportunity to interact with humans regularly , then they too can succeed on some human - guided cognitive tasks , in some cases out - performing dogs at an individual level . Similar to dogs , wolves can also follow more complex point types made with body parts other than the human arm and hand ( e.g. elbow , knee , foot ) . Both dogs and wolves have the cognitive capacity for prosocial behavior toward humans ; however it is not guaranteed . For canids to perform well on traditional human - guided tasks ( e.g. following the human point ) both relevant lifetime experiences with humans - including socialization to humans during the critical period for social development - and opportunities to associate human body parts with certain outcomes ( such as food being provided by human hands , a human throwing or kicking a ball , etc . ) are required . </P> <P> After undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task , dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human , while socialized wolves do not . </P> <H3> Reproduction ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dogs reach sexual maturity and can reproduce during their first year in contrast to a wolf at two years . The female dog can bear another litter within 8 months of the last one . The canid genus is influenced by the photoperiod and generally reproduces in the springtime . Domestic dogs are not reliant on seasonality for reproduction in contrast to the wolf , coyote , Australian dingo and African basenji that may have only one , seasonal , estrus each year . Feral dogs are influenced by the photoperiod with around half of the breeding females mating in the springtime , which is thought to indicate an ancestral reproductive trait not overcome by domestication , as can be inferred from wolves and Cape hunting dogs . </P> <P> Domestic dogs are polygamous in contrast to wolves that are generally monogamous . Therefore , domestic dogs have no pair bonding and the protection of a single mate , but rather have multiple mates in a year . There is no paternal care in dogs as opposed to wolves where all pack members assist the mother with the pups . The consequence is that wolves put a lot of energy into producing a few pups in contrast to dogs that maximize the production of pups . This higher pup production rate enables dogs to maintain or even increase their population with a lower pup survival rate than wolves , and allows dogs a greater capacity than wolves to grow their population after a population crash or when entering a new habitat . It is proposed that these differences are an alternative breeding strategy adapted to a life of scavenging instead of hunting . In contrast to domestic dogs , feral dogs are monogamous . Domestic dogs tend to have a litter size of 10 , wolves 3 , and feral dogs 5 - 8 . Feral pups have a very high mortality rate with only 5 % surviving at the age of one year , and sometimes the pups are left unattended making them vulnerable to predators . Domestic dogs stand alone among all canids for a total lack of paternal care . </P> <P> Dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species as they generally do not regurgitate food for their young , nor the young of other dogs in the same territory . However , this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs . Regurgitating of food by the females for the young , as well as care for the young by the males , has been observed in domestic dogs , dingos and in feral or semi-feral dogs . In one study of a group of free - ranging dogs , for the first 2 weeks immediately after parturition the lactating females were observed to be more aggressive to protect the pups . The male parents were in contact with the litters as ' guard ' dogs for the first 6 -- 8 weeks of the litters ' life . In absence of the mothers , they were observed to prevent the approach of strangers by vocalizations or even by physical attacks . Moreover , one male fed the litter by regurgitation showing the existence of paternal care in some free - roaming dogs </P> <H3> Space ( edit ) </H3> <P> Space used by feral dogs is not dissimilar from most other canids in that they use defined traditional areas ( home ranges ) that tend to be defended against intruders , and have core areas where most of their activities are undertaken . Urban domestic dogs have a home range of 2 - 61 hectares in contrast to a feral dogs home range of 58 square kilometers . Wolf home ranges vary from 78 square kilometers where prey is deer to 2.5 square kilometers at higher latitudes where prey is moose and caribou . Wolves will defend their territory based on prey abundance and pack density , however feral dogs will defend their home ranges all year . Where wolf ranges and feral dog ranges overlap , the feral dogs will site their core areas closer to human settlement . </P> <H3> Predation and scavenging ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite claims in the popular press , studies could not find evidence of a single predation on cattle by feral dogs . However , domestic dogs were responsible for the death of 3 calves over one 5 - year study . Other studies in Europe and North America indicate only limited success in the consumption of wild boar , deer and other ungulates , however it could not be determined if this was predation or scavenging on carcasses . Studies have observed feral dogs conducting brief , uncoordinated chases of small game with constant barking - a technique without success . </P> <P> In 2004 , a study reviewed 5 other studies of feral dogs published between 1975 and 1995 and concluded that their pack structure is very loose and rarely involves any cooperative behavior , either in raising young or in obtaining food . Feral dogs are primarily scavengers , with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins , they are poor ungulate hunters , having little effect on wildlife populations where they are sympatric . However , several garbage dumps located within the feral dog 's home range are important for their survival . Even well - fed domestic dogs are prone to scavenge ; gastro - intestinal veterinary visits increase during warmer weather as dogs are prone to eat decaying material . Some dogs consume feces , which may contain nutrition . On occasion well - fed dogs have been known to scavenge their owners ' corpses . </P> <H2> Dogs in human Society ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Human - canine bond <P> Studies using an operant framework have indicated that humans can influence the behavior of dogs through food , petting and voice . Food and 20 -- 30 seconds of petting maintained operant responding in dogs . Some dogs will show a preference for petting once food is readily available , and dogs will remain in proximity to a person providing petting and show no satiation to that stimulus . Petting alone was sufficient to maintain the operant response of military dogs to voice commands , and responses to basic obedience commands in all dogs increased when only vocal praise was provided for correct responses . </P> <P> A study using dogs that were trained to remain motionless while unsedated and unrestrained in an MRI scanner exhibited caudate activation to a hand signal associated with reward . Further work found that the magnitude of the canine caudate response is similar to that of humans , while the between - subject variability in dogs may be less than humans . In a further study , 5 scents were presented ( self , familiar human , strange human , familiar dog , strange dog ) . While the olfactory bulb / peduncle was activated to a similar degree by all the scents , the caudate was activated maximally to the familiar human . Importantly , the scent of the familiar human was not the handler , meaning that the caudate response differentiated the scent in the absence of the person being present . The caudate activation suggested that not only did the dogs discriminate that scent from the others , they had a positive association with it . Although these signals came from two different people , the humans lived in the same household as the dog and therefore represented the dog 's primary social circle . And while dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of items that are not comparable , it seems that the `` reward response '' is reserved for their humans . </P> <P> Research has shown that there are individual differences in the interactions between dogs and their human that have significant effects on dog behavior . In 1997 , a study showed that the type of relationship between dog and master , characterized as either companionship or working relationship , significantly affected the dog 's performance on a cognitive problem - solving task . They speculate that companion dogs have a more dependent relationship with their owners , and look to them to solve problems . In contrast , working dogs are more independent . </P> <H3> Dogs in the family ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2013 , a study produced the first evidence under controlled experimental observation for a correlation between the owner 's personality and their dog 's behaviour . </P> Further information : Companion dog <H3> Dogs at work ( edit ) </H3> <P> Service dogs are those that are trained to help people with disabilities such as blindness , epilepsy , diabetes and autism . Detection dogs are trained to using their sense of smell to detect substances such as explosives , illegal drugs , wildlife scat , or blood . In science , dogs have helped humans understand about the conditioned reflex . Attack dogs , dogs that have been trained to attack on command , are employed in security , police , and military roles . Service dog programs have been established to help individuals suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) and have shown to have positive results </P> <H2> Attacks ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog attack A dog 's teeth can inflict serious injuries <P> The human - dog relationship is based on unconditional trust , however if this trust is lost it will be difficult to reinstate . A dog 's thick fur protects it from the bite of another dog but humans are furless and are not so protected . </P> <P> In the UK between 2005 and 2013 , there were 17 fatal dog attacks . In 2007 - 08 there were 4,611 hospital admissions due to dog attacks , which increased to 5,221 in 2008 - 09 . It has been estimated that more than 200,000 people a year are bitten by dogs in England , with the annual cost to the National Health Service of treating injuries about £ 3 million . A report published in 2014 stated there were 6,743 hospital admissions specifically caused by dog bites , a 5.8 % increase from the 6,372 admissions in the previous 12 months . </P> <P> In the US between 1979 and 1996 , there were more than 300 human dog bite - related fatalities . In the US in 2013 , there were 31 dog - bite related deaths . Each year , more than 4.5 million people in the US are bitten by dogs and almost 1 in 5 require medical attention . </P> <P> Attack training is condemned by some as promoting ferocity in dogs ; a 1975 American study showed that 10 % of dogs that have bitten a person received attack dog training at some point . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Gray wolf # Behavior </Li> <Li> Alpha roll </Li> <Li> Dog communication </Li> <Li> Dog intelligence </Li> <Li> Calming signals </Li> <Li> Pack ( canine ) </Li> <Li> Pack hunter </Li> <Li> Attachment behaviour in wolves </Li> <Li> Separation anxiety disorder ( humans ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Levitis , Daniel ; William Z .

Little Ricky was played by a number of actors , including James John Ganzer , twins Richard and Ronald Lee Simmons , twins Michael and Joseph Mayer and , most notably , Keith Thibodeaux , billed as Little Ricky . Although the I Love Lucy announcer and the opening credits of The Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour gave his stage name as `` Little Ricky '' , in his post-Lucy acting career , particularly his four - year irregular stint on The Andy Griffith Show , he was billed as Richard Keith . </P> <P> In the show , Little Ricky is the son of Lucy Ricardo and Ricky Ricardo . Little Ricky lives with his parents in a New York Brownstone apartment building , which is owned and run by his godparents ; the family later moves to a large suburban house in Westport , Connecticut . </P> <H2> Fictional character biography ( edit ) </H2> <P> Lucy finds out she was expecting Little Ricky on the Season 2 episode `` Lucy is Enceinte .

His parents enroll him in a music school where he is the only drummer , where he forms a band named `` Ricky Ricardo and the Dixieland Band . '' Little Ricky experiences stage fright before his first music school recital but seems to overcome stage fright as he performs comfortably in many other episodes , such as `` The Ricardos Visit Cuba , '' where he plays the conga drum alongside his father ; `` Little Ricky 's School Pageant , '' where he plays the lead ; and `` Ragtime Band , '' where Little Ricky plays the drums alongside his mother and godparents . </P> <H2> Episode appearances ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Season and Episode Number </Th> <Th> Episode Title </Th> <Th> Actor portraying Little Ricky </Th> <Th> Little Ricky 's Involvement in Episode </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.16 </Td> <Td> `` Lucy Goes to the Hospital '' </Td> <Td> James John Ganzer </Td> <Td> There is only one scene in which Little Ricky appears , when the baby is brought to the maternity ward window for Ricky and the Mertz 's to see him for the first time . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.22 </Td> <Td> `` No Children Allowed '' </Td> <Td> Richard and Ronald Lee Simmons </Td> <Td> When Little Ricky cries throughout the night , neighbors complain and the clause in their lease `` No Children Allowed '' comes into play . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.24 </Td> <Td> `` The Indian Show '' </Td> <Td> Richard and Ronald Lee Simmons </Td> <Td> Lucy appears as a dancer in Ricky 's `` Waters of the Minnetonka '' number with Little Ricky strapped on her back . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.5 </Td> <Td> `` Baby Pictures '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy and Ricky promise not to show off pictures of Little Ricky like other parents do . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.9 </Td> <Td> `` Too Many Crooks '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy escapes with Little Ricky when she believes a crook named Madame X is outside on her fire escape . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.14 </Td> <Td> `` Ricky Minds the Baby '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Little Ricky spends quality time with his father when Ricky has a week off of work . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.20 </Td> <Td> `` Home Movies '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Ricky makes home movies about Little Ricky with his new movie camera and projector . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4.21 </Td> <Td> `` The Hedda Hopper Story '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Mrs. MacGillicuddy and Little Ricky arrive in California to join the Ricardos and the Mertzes . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.2 </Td> <Td> `` Lucy and John Wayne '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> After John Wayne signs his name in cement for the second time , Little Ricky is seen playing in the wet cement . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.5 </Td> <Td> `` The Great Train Robbery '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> When Mrs. MacGillicuddy and Little Ricky get moved to a different room on the train ride back to New York from California , Lucy first thinks they 've been kidnapped . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.6 </Td> <Td> `` Homecoming '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> The Ricardos , Mertzes and Little Ricky arrive back in New York . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.9 </Td> <Td> `` Nursery School '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Little Ricky gets sick after Ricky insists that Lucy enroll him in nursery school . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.13 </Td> <Td> `` Bon Voyage '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy misses the ship to Europe when she gets off to kiss Little Ricky goodbye one more time . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.22 </Td> <Td> `` Lucy Gets Homesick in Italy '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy gets homesick on Little Ricky 's birthday . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.2 </Td> <Td> `` Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky 's incessant playing causes trouble between the Ricardos and the Mertzes . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.4 </Td> <Td> `` Little Ricky gets Stage Fright '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky panics before his first music school recital . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.7 </Td> <Td> `` Deep Sea Fishing '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> The group goes fishing and there 's a bet between the men , including Little Ricky , and the women about who can catch the bigger fish . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.8 </Td> <Td> `` Desert Island '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> The group , including Little Ricky , get stranded at sea when Lucy gets only half a tank of gas for the boat . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.9 </Td> <Td> `` The Ricardos Visit Cuba '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky plays the Conga drums alongside his father in a night club performance in Cuba . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.10 </Td> <Td> `` Little Ricky 's School Pageant '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky lands the lead in his school play , `` The Enchanted Forest .

The battle took place on October 7 , 1780 , 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of the present - day town of Kings Mountain , North Carolina in what is now rural Cherokee County , South Carolina , where the Patriot militia defeated the Loyalist militia commanded by British Major Patrick Ferguson of the 71st Foot . Ignoring the participation of Ferguson , the battle has been described as `` the war 's largest all - American fight '' . </P> <P> Ferguson had arrived in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis ' main force . Ferguson issued a challenge to the rebel militias to lay down their arms or suffer the consequences . In response , the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland , James Johnston , William Campbell , John Sevier , Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson . </P> <P> Receiving intelligence on the oncoming attack , Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Lord Cornwallis ' army . However , the Patriots caught up with the Loyalists at Kings Mountain near the border with South Carolina . Achieving a complete surprise , the Patriot militiamen attacked and surrounded the Loyalists , inflicting heavy casualties . After an hour of battle , Ferguson was fatally shot while trying to break the rebel line , after which his men surrendered . Some Patriots gave no quarter until the rebel officers re-established control over their men ; they were said to be seeking revenge for alleged killings by Banastre Tarleton 's militiamen at the Battle of Waxhaws , under the slogan `` Remember Tarleton 's Quarter . '' Although victorious , the Patriots had to retreat quickly from the area for fear of Cornwallis ' advance . Later they executed nine Loyalist prisoners after a short trial . </P> <P> The battle was a pivotal moment in the Southern campaign . The surprising victory of the American patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of rebel defeats at the hands of Lord Cornwallis , and greatly raised the Patriots ' morale . With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed , Cornwallis was forced to abandon his plan to invade North Carolina and retreated into South Carolina . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Prelude to battle <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Battle of Musgrove 's Mill </Li> <Li> 1.2 Pursuit of Shelby </Li> <Li> 1.3 Muster at Sycamore Shoals </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Battle </Li> <Li> 3 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Prelude to Battle ( edit ) </H2> <P> Major Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia on May 22 , 1780 . His task was to march to the old Tryon County area , raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina Backcountry , and protect the left flank of Lord Cornwallis ' main body at Charlotte , North Carolina . </P> <H3> Battle of Musgrove 's Mill ( edit ) </H3> <P> On the morning of August 18 , 1780 two hundred mounted Patriot partisans under joint command of Colonels Isaac Shelby , James Williams , and Elijah Clarke prepared to raid a Loyalist camp at Musgrove 's Mill , which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the Enoree River . The Battle of Musgrove Mill , August 19 , 1780 occurred near a ford of the Enoree River , near the present - day border between Spartanburg , Laurens and Union Counties in South Carolina . The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists , but a local farmer informed them that the Tories had recently been reinforced by about a hundred Loyalist militia and two hundred provincial regulars on their way to join British Major Patrick Ferguson . The whole battle took perhaps an hour and within that period , sixty - three Tories were killed , an unknown number wounded , and seventy were taken prisoner . The Patriots lost only about four dead and twelve wounded . </P> <P> Some Whig leaders briefly considered attacking the Tory stronghold at Ninety Six , South Carolina ; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been defeated at Camden three days previous . </P> <H3> Pursuit of Shelby ( edit ) </H3> <P> Shelby 's forces covered sixty miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making their escape . In the wake of General Horatio Gates ' blundering defeat at Camden , the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories . </P> <P> Shelby and his Overmountain Men crossed back over the Appalachian Mountains and retreated back into the territory of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present day Elizabethton , Tennessee , and by the next month on September 25 , 1780 , Colonels Shelby , John Sevier , and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the October 7 , 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain north of present day Blacksburg , South Carolina in North Carolina . </P> <P> On September 2 , Ferguson and the militia he had already recruited marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the Appalachian Mountain hill country on what is now the Tennessee / North Carolina border . By September 10 , Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town , North Carolina and , according to Shelby issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would `` lay waste to their country with fire and sword . '' </P> <P> North Carolina Patriot militia leaders Isaac Shelby and John Sevier , from the Washington District ( now northeast Tennessee ) , met and agreed to lead their militiamen against him . </P> <H3> Muster at Sycamore Shoals ( edit ) </H3> <P> Patriot leaders also sent word to a Virginia militia leader , William Campbell , asking him to join them at Sycamore Shores. Campbell called on Benjamin Cleveland to bring his Wilkes County , North Carolina militia to the rendezvous . The detachments of Shelby , Sevier and Campbell were met by 160 North Carolina militiamen led by Charles McDowell and his brother Joseph . Campbell 's cousin , Arthur Campbell , brought 200 more Virginians . About 1,100 volunteers from southwest Virginia and today 's northeast Tennessee , known as the `` Overmountain Men '' because they had settled into the wilderness west of the Appalachian Mountains ridgeline , mustered at the rendezvous on September 25 , 1780 , at Sycamore Shoals near the modern city of Elizabethton , Tennessee . Their movement had been made possible by easing tensions with the Cherokee , thanks to diplomacy by Benjamin Cleveland 's brother - in - law , Indian agent Joseph Martin . The Overmountain Men crossed Roan Mountain the next day , and proceeded in a southerly direction for about thirteen days in anticipation of fighting the British Loyalist forces . By September 30 , they had reached Quaker Meadows , the Burke County , North Carolina home of the McDowell brothers , where they united with Benjamin Cleveland and 350 men . Now 1400 strong , the Patriots marched to South Mountain , North Carolina , The five colonels leading the Patriot force ( Shelby , Sevier , William Campbell , Joseph McDowell and Cleveland ) chose William Campbell as the nominal commander , but they agreed that all five would act in council to command their combined army . </P> Gathering of Overmountain Men at Sycamore Shoals , a black and white reproduction of Lloyd Branson 's 1915 depiction of the Patriot militias joining up <P> Meanwhile , two deserters from the Patriot militia reached Patrick Ferguson and informed him of the large body of militia advancing towards him . Waiting three days for reasons that are still unclear , Ferguson ordered a retreat to Lord Cornwallis and the British main forces in Charlotte , sending a message to Cornwallis requesting reinforcements . The request did not reach Cornwallis until one day after the battle . On October 1 , Ferguson reached North Carolina 's Broad River , where he issued another pugnacious public letter , calling the local militia to join him lest they be `` pissed upon by a set of mongrels '' ( the Overmountain Men ) . </P> <P> On October 4 , the Patriot militia reached Ferguson 's former camp at Gilbert Town , where thirty Georgia militiamen joined them , anxious for action . On October 6 , they reached Cowpens , South Carolina , ( site of the future Battle of Cowpens ) , where they received word that Ferguson was east of them , heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis . They hurried to catch him . Rebel spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1200 men . Ferguson , rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety ( just a day 's march away ) , camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements . Kings Mountain is one of many rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont , near the border between North and South Carolina . It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel , a narrow instep , and a broad rounded toe . The Loyalists camped on a ridge west of Kings Pinnacle , the highest point on Kings Mountain . </P> <P> Needing to hurry , the Patriot militia put 900 men on horseback and rode for Kings Mountain . They left immediately , marching through the night of the 6th and morning of the 7th , even though the rain never stopped . By sunrise of the 7th , they forded the Broad River , fifteen miles from Kings Mountain . By early afternoon they arrived and immediately surrounded the ridge and attacked . </P> <H2> Battle ( edit ) </H2> Kings Mountain Battle layout Don Troiani 's depiction - `` Colonel Cleveland 's War Prize Oct. 7 , 1780 '' . Col. Benjamin Cleveland returning to Wilkesboro on Patrick Ferguson 's white horse after his horse , Roebuck , and Ferguson were killed . The patriots took home drums , weapons and clothes . The other colonels awarded Cleveland with Ferguson 's white horse , which he rode home . Many consider this the greatest symbolic `` War Prize '' of the revolution and the turning point of the war . <P> The battle opened about 3 p.m. , when the 900 Patriots ( including John Crockett , father of Davy Crockett ) , approached the steep base of the western ridge . They formed eight detachments of 100 to 200 men each . Ferguson was unaware that the Patriots had caught up to him and his 1,100 men . He was the only regular British soldier in the command , composed entirely of Loyalist Carolina militia , except for the 100 or so red - uniformed Provincials ( enlisted colonials ) from New York . He had not thought it necessary to fortify his camp . </P> <P> The Patriots caught the Loyalists by surprise . Loyalist officer Alexander Chesney later wrote he did n't know the Patriots were anywhere near them until the shooting started . As the screaming Patriots charged up the hill , Captain DePeyster turned to Ferguson and said , `` These things are ominous -- these are the damned yelling boys ! '' Two parties , led by Colonels John Sevier and William Campbell , assaulted the mountains `` heel '' -- the smallest in area , but its highest point . The other detachments , led by Colonels Shelby , Williams , Lacey , Cleveland , Hambright , Winston and McDowell , attacked the main Loyalist position , surrounding the `` ball '' base beside the `` heel '' crest of the mountain . </P> <P> No one in the Patriot army held command once the fighting started . Each detachment fought independently under the previously agreed to plan to surround and destroy the Loyalists . The Patriots crept up the hill and fired from behind rocks and trees . Ferguson rallied his troops and launched a desperate bayonet - charge against Campbell and Sevier . Lacking bayonets , the Patriots ran down the hill and into the woods . Campbell soon rallied his troops , returned to the hill , and resumed firing . Ferguson ordered two more bayonet charges during the battle . This became the pattern of the battle ; the Patriots would charge up the hill , then the Tories would charge down the hill with fixed bayonets , driving the Patriots off the slopes and into the woods . Once the charge was spent and the Tories returned to their positions , the Patriots would reform in the woods , return to the base of the hill , and charge up the hill again . During one of the charges , Colonel Williams was killed , and Colonel McDowell was wounded . Firing was difficult for the Loyalists , since the Patriots constantly moved using cover and concealment to their advantage . Furthermore , the downhill angle of the hill contributed to the Loyalists overshooting their marks . </P> <P> After an hour of combat , Loyalist casualties were heavy . Ferguson rode back and forth across the hill , blowing a silver whistle he used to signal charges . Shelby , Sevier and Campbell reached the top of the hill behind the Loyalist position and attacked Ferguson 's rear . The Loyalists were driven back into their camp , where they began to surrender . Ferguson drew his sword and hacked down any small white flags that he saw popping up , but he appeared to know that the end was near . In an attempt to rally his faltering men , Ferguson shouted out `` Hurrah , brave boys , the day is ours ! '' ( sic ) He gathered a few officers together and tried to cut through the Patriot ring , but Sevier 's men fired a volley and Ferguson was shot and dragged by his horse behind the Patriot line . There he was confronted by an opposing rebel officer , who demanded a surrender from the major . Ferguson shot and killed the man with his pistol in a final act of defiance , but was immediately shot dead by multiple Patriots on the spot . When the Patriots recovered his corpse , they counted seven bullet wounds . </P> <P> Seeing their leader fall , the Loyalists began to surrender . Some Patriots did not want to take prisoners , as they were eager to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or ' Tarleton 's Quarter , ' in which Banastre Tarleton 's forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford 's Continental soldiers after the latter tried to surrender . ( At Waxhaws , Tarleton 's horse was shot , pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of surrender . ) Also , other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender . </P> <P> Loyalist Captain Abraham DePeyster , in command after Ferguson was killed , sent out an emissary with a white flag , asking for quarter . For several minutes , the Patriots rejected DePeyster 's white flag and continued firing , many of them shouting , `` Give ' em Tarleton 's Quarter ! '' and `` Give them Buford 's play ! '' A significant number of the surrendering Loyalists were killed and / or wounded including the white flag emissary . When DePeyster sent out a second white flag , a few of the rebel officers , including Campbell and Sevier , ran forward and took control by ordering their men to cease fire . They took about 800 Loyalist prisoners . </P> <H2> Aftermath ( edit ) </H2> Map spot for Blacksburg , South Carolina <P> The Battle of Kings Mountain lasted 65 minutes . The Loyalists suffered 290 killed , 163 wounded , and 668 taken prisoner . The Patriot militia suffered 28 killed and 60 wounded . The Patriots had to move out quickly for fear that Cornwallis would advance to meet them . Loyalist prisoners well enough to walk were herded to camps several miles from the battlefield . The dead were buried in shallow graves and wounded were left on the field to die . Ferguson 's corpse was later reported to have been desecrated and wrapped in oxhide before burial . Both victors and captives came near to starvation on the march due to a lack of supplies in the hastily organized Patriot army . </P> <P> On October 14 , the retreating Patriot force held drumhead courts - martial of Loyalists on various charges ( treason , desertion from Patriot militias , incitement of Indian rebellion ) . Passing through the Sunshine community in what is now Rutherford County , N.C. , the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family . Aaron Biggerstaff , a Loyalist , had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded . His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner - of - war on a British ship docked at Charleston , S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour 's Mill ( modern Lincolnton , N.C. ) , in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on one side or the other . </P> <P> While stopped on the Biggerstaff land , the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners . Some were testified against by Patriots who had previously fought alongside them and later changed sides . Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought an end to the proceedings . His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea for mercy from one of the Biggerstaff women , although accounts vary as to whether it was Martha Biggerstaff , Aaron 's wife , or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff , Benjamin 's wife . Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days , while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands . The column finally made camp at Salem , North Carolina . </P> <P> Kings Mountain was a pivotal moment in the history of the American Revolution . Coming after a series of disasters and humiliations in the Carolinas -- the fall of Charleston and capture of the American army there , the destruction of another American army at the Battle of Camden , the Waxhaws Massacre -- the surprising , decisive victory at Kings Mountain was a great boost to Patriot morale . The Tories of the Carolina back country were broken as a military force . Additionally , the destruction of Ferguson 's command and the looming threat of Patriot militia in the mountains caused Lord Cornwallis to cancel his plans to invade North Carolina ; he instead evacuated Charlotte and retreated to South Carolina . He would not return to North Carolina until early 1781 , when he was chasing Nathanael Greene after the Americans had dealt British forces another defeat at the Battle of Cowpens . </P> <P> In The Winning of the West , Theodore Roosevelt wrote of Kings Mountain , `` This brilliant victory marked the turning point of the American Revolution . '' Thomas Jefferson called it , `` The turn of the tide of success . '' President Herbert Hoover at Kings Mountain said , </P> <P> This is a place of inspiring memories . Here less than a thousand men , inspired by the urge of freedom , defeated a superior force entrenched in this strategic position . This small band of Patriots turned back a dangerous invasion well designed to separate and dismember the united Colonies . It was a little army and a little battle , but it was of mighty portent . History has done scant justice to its significance , which rightly should place it beside Lexington , Bunker Hill , Trenton and Yorktown . </P> <P> In 1931 , the Congress of the United States created the Kings Mountain National Military Park at the site of the battle . The park headquarters is in Blacksburg , South Carolina , and hosts hundreds of thousands of people each year . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> American Revolutionary War portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of American Revolutionary War battles </Li> </Ul> <H2> Footnotes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Formal Report of the Battle of King 's Mountain ; Oct 1780 ; `` A Statement of the Proceedings of the Western Army ; Letter to General Gates ; '' at Tennessee GenWeb ; text : ... reprinted by the East Tennessee Historical Society , Knoxville , Tennessee , 1967 , pp. 243 - 5 , which shows 53 ( instead of 55 ) privates wounded for total of 60 wounded ; accessed January 2017 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Dameron p. 76 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` The American revolution revisited '' .

At the time , the fortress of Upnor Castle and a barrier chain called the `` Gillingham Line '' were supposed to protect the mothballed naval ships anchored off Chatham , the main English naval base in southeastern Stuart England . </P> <P> The Dutch , under nominal command of Lieutenant - Admiral Michiel de Ruyter , over several days bombarded and then captured the town of Sheerness , sailed up the River Thames to Gravesend , then risking the perils of its treacherous shallows , sandbars and shoals , sailed up the River Medway to Chatham and Gillingham , where they engaged fortifications with cannon fire , burned three capital ships and ten lesser naval vessels , and captured and towed away two ships of the line : HMS Unity and the pride and normal flagship of the English fleet , HMS Royal Charles . </P> <P> Politically , the raid was disastrous for King Charles ' war plans and led to a quick end to the war and a favourable peace for the Dutch . It was one of the worst defeats in the Royal Navy 's history , and one of the worst suffered by the British military .

The Dutch seized this opportunity to attack the English . They had made earlier plans for such an attack in 1666 after the Four Days Battle but were prevented from carrying them out by their defeat in the St James 's Day Battle . The mastermind behind the plan was the leading Dutch politician Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt . His brother Cornelis de Witt accompanied the fleet to supervise . Peace negotiations had already been in progress at Breda since March , but Charles had been procrastinating over the signing of peace , hoping to improve his position through secret French assistance . Based on these assumptions De Witt thought it best to end the war quickly with a clear victory , thereby ensuring a more advantageous settlement for the Dutch Republic . Most Dutch flag officers had strong doubts about the feasibility of such a daring attack , fearing the treacherous shoals in the Thames estuary , but they obeyed orders nevertheless . The Dutch made use of two English pilots who had defected , one a dissenter named Robert Holland , the other a smuggler who had fled English justice . </P> <H2> The raid ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

( June 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> The Dutch approach ( edit ) </H3> <P> On 17 May the squadron of the Admiralty of Rotterdam with De Ruyter sailed to the Texel to join those of Amsterdam and the Northern Quarter . Hearing that the squadron of Frisia was not yet ready because of recruiting problems ( impressment being forbidden in the Republic ) , he left for the Schooneveld off the Dutch coast to join the squadron of Zealand that , however , suffered from similar problems . De Ruyter then departed for the Thames on 4 June ( Old Style used by the English , the Dutch at the time were officially using New Style dates ) with 62 frigates or ships - of - the - line , about fifteen lighter ships and twelve fireships , when the wind turned to the east . The fleet was reorganised into three squadrons : the first was commanded by De Ruyter himself , with as Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde and Rear - Admiral Jan Jansse van Nes ; the second was commanded by Lieutenant - Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes with as Vice-Admiral Enno Doedes Star and Rear - Admiral Willem van der Zaan ; the third was commanded by Lieutenant - Admiral Baron Willem Joseph van Ghent with Lieutenant - Admiral Jan van Meppel in subcommand and as Vice-Admirals Isaac Sweers and Volckert Schram and as Rear - Admirals David Vlugh and Jan Gideonsz Verburgh . The third squadron thus effectively had a second set of commanders ; this was done to use these as flag officers of a special frigate landing force , to be formed on arrival and to be headed by Colonel and Lieutenant - Admiral Van Ghent , on the frigate Agatha . Baron Van Ghent was in fact the real commander of the expedition and had done all the operational planning , as he had been the former commander of the Dutch Marine Corps , the first in history to be specialised in amphibious operations , that now was headed by the Englishman Colonel Thomas Dolman . </P> Map showing the events <P> On 6 June a fog bank was blown away and revealed the Dutch task force , sailing into the mouth of the Thames . On 7 June Cornelis de Witt revealed his secret instructions from the States General , written on 20 May , in the presence of all commanders . There were so many objections , while De Ruyter 's only substantial contribution to the discussion was `` bevelen zijn bevelen `` ( '' orders are orders `` ) , that Cornelis , after retiring to his cabin late in the night , wrote in his daily report he did not feel at all sure that he would be obeyed . The next day it transpired however that most officers were in for a bit of adventure ; they had just given their professional opinion for the record so they could blame the politicians should the whole enterprise end in disaster . That day an attempt was made to capture a fleet of twenty English merchantmen seen higher up the Thames in the direction of London , but this failed as these fled to the west , beyond Gravesend . </P> <P> The attack caught the English unawares . No serious preparations had been made for such an eventuality , although there had been ample warning from the extensive English spy network . Most frigates were assembled in squadrons at Harwich and in Scotland , leaving the London area to be protected by only a small number of active ships , most of them prizes taken earlier in the war from the Dutch . As a further measure of economy , on 24 March the Duke of York had ordered the discharge of most of the crews of the prize vessels , leaving only three guard ships at the Medway ; in compensation the crew of one of them , the frigate Unity ( the first ship to be captured from the Dutch in 1665 , from the privateer Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest ) was raised from forty to sixty ; also the number of fireships was increased from one to three . Additionally thirty large sloops were to be prepared to row any ship to safety in case of an emergency . Sir William Coventry declared that a Dutch landing near London was very unlikely ; at most the Dutch , to bolster their morale , would launch a token attack at some medium - sized and exposed target like Harwich , which place therefore had been strongly fortified in the spring . There was no clear line of command with most responsible authorities giving hasty orders without bothering to co-ordinate them first . As a result , there was much confusion . Charles did not take matters into his own hands , deferring mostly to the opinion of others . English morale was low . Not having been paid for months or even years , most sailors and soldiers were less than enthusiastic to risk their lives . England had only a small army and the few available units were dispersed as Dutch intentions were unclear . This explains why no effective countermeasures were taken though it took the Dutch about five days to reach Chatham , slowly manoeuvring through the shoals , leaving the heavier vessels behind as a covering force . They could only advance in jumps when the tide was favourable . </P> The Battle of Chatham by Willem van der Stoop . Skokloster castle , Sweden . <P> After raising the alarm on 6 June at Chatham Dockyard , Commissioner Peter Pett seems not to have taken any further action until 9 June when , late in the afternoon , a fleet of about thirty Dutch ships was sighted in the Thames off Sheerness . At this point the Commissioner immediately sought assistance from the Admiralty , sending a pessimistic message to the Navy Board , lamenting the absence of Navy senior officials whose help and advice he believed he needed . The thirty ships were those of Van Ghent 's squadron of frigates . The Dutch fleet carried about a thousand marines and landing parties were dispatched to Canvey Island in Essex and opposite on the Kent side at Sheerness . These men had strict orders by Cornelis de Witt not to plunder , as the Dutch wanted to shame the English whose troops had sacked Terschelling during Holmes 's Bonfire in August 1666 . Nevertheless , the crew of Captain Jan van Brakel could not control themselves . They were driven off by English militia , and found themselves under threat of severe punishment upon returning to the Dutch fleet . Van Brakel offered to lead the attack the next day to avoid the penalty . </P> <P> The King ordered the Earl of Oxford on 8 June to mobilise the militia of all counties around London ; also all available barges should be used to lay a ship 's bridge across the Lower Thames , so that the English cavalry could quickly switch positions from one bank to the other . Sir Edward Spragge , the famous Vice-Admiral , learned on 9 June that a Dutch raiding party had come ashore on the Isle of Grain ( a peninsula where the river Medway in Kent , meets the River Thames ) . Musketeers from the Sheerness garrison opposite were sent to investigate . </P> <P> Only in the afternoon of 10 June did the King instruct Admiral George Monck , Duke of Albemarle to go to Chatham to take charge of matters , a full three days later ordering Admiral Prince Rupert to organise the defences at Woolwich . Albemarle went first to Gravesend where he noted to his dismay that there and at Tilbury only a few guns were present , too few to halt a possible Dutch advance upon the Thames . To prevent such a disaster , he ordered all available artillery from the capital to be positioned at Gravesend . On 11 June ( Old Style ) he went to Chatham , expecting the place to be well prepared for an attack . Two members of the Navy Board , Sir John Mennes and Lord Henry Brouncker , had already travelled there on the same day . When Albemarle arrived , however , he found only twelve of the eight hundred dockyard men expected and these in a state of panic ; of the thirty sloops only ten were present , the other twenty having been used to evacuate the personal possessions of several officials , such as Pett 's ship models . No munitions or powder were available and the six - inch thick iron chain that blocked the Medway had not yet been protected by batteries . This chain system had been built during the English Civil War to repel a possible attack by the Royalist fleet , replacing earlier versions , the first dating back to 1585 . Albemarle immediately ordered the artillery to be moved from Gravesend to Chatham , which would take a day . </P> <H3> The attack ( edit ) </H3> A picture by Willem Schellincks of the raid . The view is from the south . On the left Upnor Castle is silhouetted against the flames ; on the opposite side of the river more to the front the burning dockyard of Chatham . To the north the conflagration near the chain is shown and on the horizon the ruins of Sheerness Fort are still smoking <P> The Dutch fleet arrived at the Isle of Sheppey on 10 June , and launched an attack on the incomplete Garrison Point Fort . Captain Jan van Brakel in Vrede , ( `` Peace '' ) followed by two other men - of - war , sailed as close to the fort as possible to engage it with cannon fire . Sir Edward Spragge was in command of the ships at anchor in the Medway and those off Sheerness , but the only ship able to defend against the Dutch was the frigate Unity , which was stationed off the fort . </P> <P> The Unity was supported by a number of ketches and fireships at Garrison Point , and by the fort , where sixteen guns had been hastily placed . The Unity fired one broadside , but then , when attacked by a Dutch fireship , she withdrew up the Medway , followed by the English fireships and ketches . The Dutch fired on the fort ; two men were hit . It then transpired that no surgeon was available and most of the soldiers of the Scottish garrison now deserted . Seven remained , but their position became untenable when some 800 Dutch marines landed about a mile away . With Sheerness thus lost , its guns being captured by the Dutch and the building blown up , Spragge sailed up river for Chatham on his yacht the Henrietta . Many officers were now assembled there : Spragge himself , the next day also Monck and several men of the admiralty board . All gave orders countermanding those of the others so that utter confusion reigned . </P> <P> As his artillery would not arrive soon , Monck on the 11th ordered a squadron of cavalry and a company of soldiers to reinforce Upnor Castle . River defences were hastily improvised with blockships sunk , and the chain across the river was guarded by light batteries . Pett proposed that several big and smaller ships be sunk to block the Musselbank channel in front of the chain . This way the large Golden Phoenix and the House of Sweden ( the former VOC -- ships Gulden Phenix and Huis van Swieten ) and the Welcome and the Leicester were lost and the smaller Constant John , Unicorn and John and Sarah ; when this was shown by Spragge to be insufficient , personally sounding the depth of a second channel despite the assurances by Pett , they were joined by the Barbados Merchant , Dolphin , Edward and Eve , Hind and Fortune . To do this the men first intended for the warships to be protected were used , so the most valuable ships were basically without crews . These blockships were placed in a rather easterly position , on the line Upchurch -- Stoke , and could not be covered by fire . Monck then decided also to sink blockships in Upnor Reach near Upnor Castle , presenting another barrier to the Dutch should they break through the chain at Gillingham . The defensive chain placed across the river had at its lowest point been lying practically nine feet ( about three metres ) under the water between its stages , owing to its weight , so it was still possible for light ships to pass it . Attempts were made to raise it by placing stages under it closer to the shore . </P> <P> The positions of the Charles V and the Matthias ( former Dutch merchantmen Carolus Quintus and Geldersche Ruyter ) , just above the chain were adjusted to enable them to bring their broadsides to bear upon it . The Monmouth was also moored above the chain , positioned so that she could bring her guns to bear on the space between the Charles V and the Matthias . The frigate Marmaduke and the Norway Merchant were sunk above the chain ; the large Sancta Maria ( former VOC - ship Slot van Honingen of 70 cannon ) foundered while being moved for the same purpose . Pett also informed Monck that the Royal Charles had to be moved upriver . He had been ordered by the Duke of York on 27 March to do this , but as yet had not complied . Monck at first refused to make available some of his small number of sloops , as they were needed to move supplies ; when he at last found the captain of the Matthias willing to assist , Pett answered that it was too late as he was busy sinking the blockships and there was no pilot to be found daring to take such a risk anyway . Meanwhile , the first Dutch frigates to arrive had already begun to move the Edward and Eve away , clearing a channel by nightfall . </P> `` Burning English ships '' by Jan van Leyden . Shown are the events near Gillingham : in the middle the Royal Charles is taken ; on the right Pro Patria and Schiedam set Matthias and Charles V alight <P> Van Ghent 's squadron now advanced up the Medway on 12 June , attacking the English defences at the chain . First Unity was taken by Van Brakel by assault . Then the fireship Pro Patria under commander Jan Daniëlsz van Rijn broke through the chain ( or sailed over it according to some historians , distrusting the more spectacular traditional version of events ) , the stages of which were soon after destroyed by Dutch engineers commanded by Rear - Admiral David Vlugh . She then destroyed the Matthias by fire . The fireships Catharina and Schiedam attacked the Charles V ; the Catharina under commander Hendrik Hendriksz was sunk by the shore batteries but the Schiedam under commander Gerrit Andriesz Mak set the Charles V alight ; the crew was captured by Van Brakel . The Royal Charles , with only thirty cannon aboard and abandoned by her skeleton crew when they saw the Matthias burn , was then captured by the Irishman Thomas Tobiasz , the flag captain of Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde , and carried off to the Netherlands despite an unfavourable tide . This was made possible by lowering her draught by bringing her into a slight tilt . The jack was struck while a trumpeter played `` Joan 's placket is torn '' . Only the Monmouth escaped . Seeing the disaster Monck ordered all sixteen remaining warships further up to be sunk to prevent them from being captured , making for a total of about thirty ships deliberately sunk by the English themselves . As Andrew Marvell satirised : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Of all our navy none should now survive , </Dd> <Dd> But that the ships themselves were taught to dive </Dd> </Dl> <P> On 13 June , the whole of the Thames side as far up as London was in a panic -- some spread the rumour that the Dutch were in the process of transporting a French army from Dunkirk for a full - scale invasion -- and many wealthy citizens fled the city , taking their most valuable possessions with them . The Dutch continued their advance into the Chatham docks with the fireships Delft , Rotterdam , Draak , Wapen van Londen , Gouden Appel and Princess , under English fire from Upnor Castle and from three shore batteries . A number of Dutch frigates suppressed the English fire , themselves suffering about forty casualties in dead and wounded . Three of the finest and heaviest vessels in the navy , already sunk to prevent capture , now perished by fire : first the Loyal London , set alight by the Rotterdam under commander Cornelis Jacobsz van der Hoeven ; then the Royal James and finally the Royal Oak , that withstood attempts by two fireships but was burnt by a third . The English crews abandoned their half - flooded ships , mostly without a fight , a notable exception being army Captain Archibald Douglas , of the Scots Foot , who personally refused to abandon the Oak and perished in the flames . The Monmouth again escaped . The raid thus cost the English four of their remaining eight ships with more than 75 cannon . Three of the four largest `` big ships '' of the navy were lost . The remaining `` big ship '' , the Royal Sovereign ( the former Sovereign of the Seas rebuilt as a two - decker ) , was preserved due to her being at Portsmouth at the time . De Ruyter now joined Van Ghent 's squadron in person . </P> <H2> Account by Samuel Pepys ( edit ) </H2> Portrait of Samuel Pepys by J. Hayls <P> The diary of Samuel Pepys , as secretary of the Navy Board , is very often cited in descriptions of the raid , as it gives us direct information about the attitude of the policy makers in this period and of the psychological impact of the attack . </P> <P> Pepys at first seems to accept the consensus that the Dutch would not dare to launch an expedition against the London area ; still on 18 April he writes : `` ( ... ) then to the office , where the news is strong that not only the Dutch can not set out a fleete this year , but that the French will not , and that he ( Louis XIV ) hath given the answer to the Dutch Embassador , saying that he is for the King of England 's having an honourable peace , which , if true , is the best news we have had a good while . '' At that moment De Ruyter had already been on De Zeven Provinciën for a week . Nevertheless , he is aware of the preparations at Chatham , writing on 23 March : `` At the office all the morning , where Sir W. Pen ( sic ) come , being returned from Chatham , from considering the means of fortifying the river Medway , by a chain at the stakes , and ships laid there with guns to keep the enemy from coming up to burn our ships ; all our care now being to fortify ourselves against their invading us . '' Also he is the next day present at the meeting where the details are given : `` All their care they now take is to fortify themselves , and are not ashamed of it : for when by and by my Lord Arlington come in with letters , and seeing the King and Duke of York give us and the officers of the Ordnance directions in this matter , he did move that we might do it as privately as we could , that it might not come into the Dutch Gazette presently , as the King 's and Duke of York 's going down the other day to Sheerenesse was , the week after , in the Harlem Gazette . The King and Duke of York both laughed at it , and made no matter , but said , ' Let us be safe , and let them talk , for there is nothing will trouble them more , nor will prevent their coming more , than to hear that we are fortifying ourselves ' . '' </P> <P> Only on 3 June does Pepys become aware that the Dutch are out in force : `` the Dutch are known to be abroad with eighty sail of ships of war , and twenty fire - ships ; and the French come into the Channell with twenty sail of men - of - war , and five fireships , while we have not a ship at sea to do them any hurt with ; but are calling in all we can , while our Embassadors are treating at Bredah ; and the Dutch look upon them as come to beg peace , and use them accordingly ; and all this through the negligence of our Prince , who hath power , if he would , to master all these with the money and men that he hath had the command of , and may now have , if he would mind his business . '' </P> <P> Not until 10 June does Pepys understand that the Thames is the target : `` News brought us that , the Dutch are come up as high as the Nore ; and more pressing orders for fireships . '' The next day a growing sense of panic becomes apparent : `` Up , and more letters still from Sir W. Coventry about more fire - ships , and so Sir W. Batten and I to the office , where Bruncker come to us , who is just now going to Chatham upon a desire of Commissioner Pett 's , who is in a very fearful stink for fear of the Dutch , and desires help for God and the King and kingdom 's sake . So Bruncker goes down , and Sir J. Minnes also , from Gravesend . This morning Pett writes us word that Sheernesse is lost last night , after two or three hours ' dispute . The enemy hath possessed himself of that place ; which is very sad , and puts us into great fears of Chatham . '' In the morning of the 12th he is reassured by the measures taken by Monck : `` ( ... ) met Sir W. Coventry 's boy ; and there in his letter find that the Dutch had made no motion since their taking Sheernesse ; and the Duke of Albemarle writes that all is safe as to the great ships against any assault , the boom and chaine being so fortified ; which put my heart into great joy . '' Soon , however , this confidence is shattered : `` ( ... ) his clerk , Powell , do tell me that ill newes is come to Court of the Dutch breaking the Chaine at Chatham ; which struck me to the heart . And to White Hall to hear the truth of it ; and there , going up the back - stairs , I did hear some lacquies speaking of sad newes come to Court , saying , that hardly anybody in the Court but do look as if he cried ( ... ) . '' </P> <P> Pepys immediately draws the conclusion that this will mean the end of Charles 's regime and that a revolution is inevitable : `` All our hearts do now ake ; for the newes is true , that the Dutch have broke the chaine and burned our ships , and particularly `` The Royal Charles '' , other particulars I know not , but most sad to be sure . And , the truth is , I do fear so much that the whole kingdom is undone , that I do this night resolve to study with my father and wife what to do with the little that I have in money by me ( ... ) . </P> <P> On the 13th , the countermeasures proposed only increase his fears and make him decide to take his family and capital to safety : `` No sooner up but hear the sad newes confirmed of the Royall Charles being taken by them , and now in fitting by them -- which Pett should have carried up higher by our several orders , and deserves , therefore , to be hanged for not doing it -- and turning several others ; and that another fleete is come up into the Hope . Upon which newes the King and Duke of York have been below ( London Bridge ) since four o'clock in the morning , to command the sinking of ships at Barking - Creeke , and other places , to stop their coming up higher : which put me into such a fear , that I presently resolved of my father 's and wife 's going into the country ; and , at two hours ' warning , they did go by the coach this day , with about £ 1300 in gold in their night - bag . '' The entire city is in a state of panic : `` ( ... ) never were people so dejected as they are in the City all over at this day ; and do talk most loudly , even treason ; as , that we are bought and sold -- that we are betrayed by the Papists , and others , about the King ; cry out that the office of the Ordnance hath been so backward as no powder to have been at Chatham nor Upnor Castle till such a time , and the carriages all broken ; that Legg is a Papist ; that Upnor , the old good castle built by Queen Elizabeth , should be lately slighted ; that the ships at Chatham should not be carried up higher . They look upon us as lost , and remove their families and rich goods in the City ; and do think verily that the French , being come down with his army to Dunkirke , it is to invade us , and that we shall be invaded . '' Then even worse news is brought : `` Late at night comes Mr. Hudson , the cooper , my neighbour , and tells me that he come from Chatham this evening at five o'clock , and saw this afternoon `` The Royal James , '' `` Oake , '' and `` London , '' burnt by the enemy with their fire - ships : that two or three men - of - war come up with them , and made no more of Upnor Castle 's shooting , than of a fly ( ... ) . '' </P> <P> On the 14th more details become known of the events the previous day , showing the morale of the sailors : `` ( he ) did hear many Englishmen aboard the Dutch ships speaking to one another in English , and that they did cry and say : We did heretofore fight for tickets ; now we fight for dollars ! and did ask how such and such a one did , and would commend themselves to them : which is a sad consideration '' , and the mood of the people towards Charles `` they did in open streets yesterday at Westminster , cry , ' A Parliament ! a Parliament ! ' ; and I do believe it will cost blood to answer for these miscarriages . '' </P> <H2> The Dutch withdraw ( edit ) </H2> A copy of the Sea Triumph depicting Cornelis de Witt <P> As he expected a stiffening English resistance , Cornelis de Witt on 14 June decided to forego a further penetration and withdraw , towing the Royal Charles along as a war trophy ; the Unity also was removed with a prize crew . This decision saved the sunken - off capital ships the Royal Katherine , the Unicorn , the Victory and the St George . However , Dutch demolition teams that day rowed on boats to any ship they could reach to burn her down as much as they could , thus ensuring their reward money . One boat even re-entered the docks to make sure nothing was left above the waterline of the Oak , the James and the London ; another , by accident or malicious intent , burnt the Slot van Honingen , though it had been intended to salvage this precious merchantman . Also Chatham Dockyard escaped a destruction which might have prevented the rebuilding of the English navy for decades . Now the English villages were plundered -- by their own troops . The Dutch fleet , after celebrating by collectively thanking God for `` a great victory in a just war in self - defence '' tried to repeat its success by attacking several other ports on the English east coast but was repelled each time . On 27 June an attempt to enter the Thames beyond Gravesend was called off when it became known that the river was blocked by blockships and five fireships awaited the Dutch attack . On 2 July a Dutch marine force landed near Woodbridge north of Harwich and successfully prevented Landguard Fort from being reinforced but a direct assault on the fort by 1500 marines was beaten off by the garrison . On 3 July an attack on Osley Bay failed . On 21 July Julian calendar peace was signed . </P> <P> But still , Samuel Pepys notes in his diary on 19 July 1667 : `` The Dutch fleete are in great squadrons everywhere still about Harwich , and were lately at Portsmouth ; and the last letters say at Plymouth , and now gone to Dartmouth to destroy our Streights ' fleete lately got in thither ; but God knows whether they can do it any hurt , or no , but it was pretty news come the other day so fast , of the Dutch fleets being in so many places , that Sir W. Batten at table cried , By God , says he , I think the Devil shits Dutchmen . '' </P> <P> And on 29 July 1667 : `` Thus in all things , in wisdom , courage , force , knowledge of our own streams , and success , the Dutch have the best of us , and do end the war with victory on their side '' . </P> <H2> Aftermath ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wharf official John Norman estimated the damage caused by the raid at about £ 20,000 , apart from the replacement costs of the four lost capital ships ; the total loss of the Royal Navy must have been close to £ 200,000 . Pett was made a scapegoat , bailed at £ 5,000 and deprived of his office while those who had ignored his earlier warnings quietly escaped any blame . The Royal James , Oak and Loyal London were in the end salvaged and rebuilt , but at great cost and when the City of London refused to share in it , Charles had the name of the latter ship changed to a simple London . For a few years the English fleet was handicapped by its losses during the raid , but by around 1670 a new building programme had restored the English Navy to its former power . </P> Royal Charles stern piece at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam <P> The Raid on the Medway was a serious blow to the reputation of the English crown . Charles felt personally offended by the fact the Dutch had attacked while he had laid up his fleet and peace negotiations were in progress , conveniently forgetting he himself had not negotiated in good faith . His resentment was one of the causes of the Third Anglo - Dutch War as it made him enter into the secret Treaty of Dover with Louis XIV of France . In the 19th century , nationalistic British writers expanded on this theme by suggesting it had been the Dutch who had sued for peace after their defeats in 1666 -- although in fact these had made them , if anything , more belligerent -- and that only by treacherously attacking the English had they nevertheless been able to gain a victory ; a typical example of this is When London burned , written by the novelist G.A. Henty in 1895 . In the short term , the Lord Chancellor , Edward Hyde , 1st Earl of Clarendon was made the scapegoat , impeached and forced into exile . </P> <P> Total losses for the Dutch were eight spent fireships and about fifty casualties . In the Republic the populace was jubilant after the victory ; many festivities were held , repeated when the fleet returned in October , the various admirals being hailed as heroes . They were rewarded by a flood of eulogies and given honorary golden chains and pensions by the States General and the lesser States of the Provinces ; De Ruyter , Cornelis de Witt and Van Ghent were honoured by precious enamelled golden chalices made by Nicolaes Lockeman , depicting the events . Cornelis de Witt had a large `` Sea Triumph '' painted , with himself as the main subject , which was displayed in the townhall of Dordt . This triumphalism by De Witt 's States faction caused resentment with the rivalling Orangist faction ; when the States regime lost its power during the rampjaar of 1672 , Cornelis 's head was to be ceremoniously carved out from the painting , after Charles had for some years insisted the picture would be removed . </P> <P> The Royal Charles , her draught too deep to be of use in the shallow Dutch waters , was permanently drydocked near Hellevoetsluis as a tourist attraction , with day trips being organised for large parties , often of foreign state guests . After vehement protests by Charles that this insulted his honour , the official visits were ended and the Royal Charles was eventually scrapped in 1672 ; however , part of her transom , bearing the coat of arms with the Lion and Unicorn and the Royal inscription Dieu et mon droit , was preserved because Charles earlier had demanded its removal and it has since 1883 been put on display in the cellar of the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam . </P> <P> On 14 March 2012 the transom was transported to England on board the Royal Netherlands Navy patrol ship Holland , accompanied by the Dutch crown prince Willem - Alexander , where it was put on display , in commodate , at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich as part of the Royal River : Power , Pageantry and the Thames exhibition held on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II . </P> <H2> Rudyard Kipling ( edit ) </H2> <P> Almost 250 years later , Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem `` The Dutch in the Medway ( 1664 - 72 ) '' about these events ( giving a not altogether historically correct account ) for C.R.L. Fletcher 's A History of England ( 1911 ) : </P> <Dl> <Dd> If wars were won by feasting , </Dd> <Dd> Or victory by song , </Dd> <Dd> Or safety found , by sleeping sound </Dd> <Dd> How England would be strong ! </Dd> <Dd> But honour and dominion </Dd> <Dd> Are not maintained so , </Dd> <Dd> They 're only got by sword and shot </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> The moneys that should feed us </Dd> <Dd> You spend on your delight , </Dd> <Dd> How can you then , have sailor - men </Dd> <Dd> To aid you in your fight ? </Dd> <Dd> Our fish and cheese are rotten , </Dd> <Dd> Which makes the scurvy grow -- </Dd> <Dd> We can not serve you if we starve , : </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> Our ships in every harbour </Dd> <Dd> Be neither whole nor sound , </Dd> <Dd> And when we seek to mend a leak , </Dd> <Dd> No oakum can be found , </Dd> <Dd> Or , if it is , the caulkers , </Dd> <Dd> And carpenters also , </Dd> <Dd> For lack of pay have gone away , </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> Mere powder , guns and bullets , </Dd> <Dd> we scarce can get at all ; </Dd> <Dd> Their price was spent in merriment </Dd> <Dd> And revel at Whitehall , </Dd> <Dd> While we in tattered doublets </Dd> <Dd> From ship to ship must row , </Dd> <Dd> Beseeching friends for odds and ends -- </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> No King will heed our warnings , </Dd> <Dd> No Court will pay our claims -- </Dd> <Dd> Our King and Court for their disport </Dd> <Dd> Do sell the very Thames ! </Dd> <Dd> For , now De Ruyter 's topsails </Dd> <Dd> Off naked Chatham show , </Dd> <Dd> We dare not meet him with our fleet -- </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <H2> 1941 `` replay '' ( edit ) </H2> <P> On 14 December 1941 a Dutch minelayer named after Jan van Brakel , which was serving as a convoy escort on the UK eastern coast , accidentally hit the anchor buoy of one of the gate vessels which were protecting the entrance to the Medway during World War II . The commander reported this incident to the port authorities , signalling : `` Van Brakel damaged boom defence Medway '' . The instant reply was : `` What , again ?

Her mother was of Lithuanian Jewish and French Quebec ancestry , and her father was a Jewish emigrant from Odessa , Russia . The family resided at 75 Orange Street . As a small child , Foray first wanted to be a dancer , so her mother sent her to a local classes , but she had to drop out due to a case of pneumonia . Her voice was first broadcast in a local radio drama when she was 12 years old ; by age 15 , she was doing regular radio voice work . </P> <P> Two years later , after graduating from Classical High School , she moved with her parents and siblings to Los Angeles , near Ida 's brother , after Morris Forer , an engineer , fell on hard financial times . </P> <H2> Acting career ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

( August 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> After entering radio through the WBZA Players , Foray starred in her own radio series Lady Make Believe in the late 1930s . She soon became a popular voice actress , with regular appearances on coast - to - coast network shows including Lux Radio Theatre and The Jimmy Durante Show . </P> <P> In the 1940s , Foray also began film work , including a few roles in live action movies , but mostly doing voice overs for animated cartoons and radio programs and occasionally dubbing films and television . On radio , Foray did the voices of Midnight the Cat and Old Grandie the Piano on The Buster Brown Program , which starred Smilin ' Ed McConnell , from 1944 to 1952 . She later did voices on the Mutual Broadcasting System program Smile Time for Steve Allen . Her work in radio ultimately led her to recording for a number of children 's albums for Capitol Records . </P> <P> For Walt Disney , Foray voiced Lucifer the Cat in the feature film Cinderella , Lambert 's mother in Lambert the Sheepish Lion , a mermaid in Peter Pan and Witch Hazel in the Donald Duck short Trick or Treat . Decades later , Foray would be the voice of Grandmother Fa in the 1998 animated Disney film Mulan . She also did a variety of voices in Walter Lantz 's Woody Woodpecker cartoons , including Woody 's nephew and niece , Knothead and Splinter . Impressed by her performance as Witch Hazel , in 1954 Chuck Jones invited her over to Warner Brothers Cartoons . For Warner Brothers , she was Granny ( whom she has played on vinyl records starting in 1950 , before officially voicing her in Red Riding Hoodwinked , released in 1955 , taking over for Bea Benaderet ) , owner of Tweety and Sylvester , and a series of witches , including Looney Tunes ' own Witch Hazel , with Jones as director . Like most of Warner Brothers ' voice actors at the time ( with the exception of Mel Blanc ) , Foray was not credited for her roles in these cartoons . </P> <P> She played Bubbles on The Super 6 and Cindy Lou Who , asking `` Santa '' why he 's taking their tree , in How the Grinch Stole Christmas . In 1960 , she provided the speech for Mattel 's original `` Chatty Cathy '' doll ; capitalizing on this , Foray also voiced the malevolent `` Talky Tina '' doll in the Twilight Zone episode `` Living Doll '' , first aired on November 1 , 1963 . </P> June Foray , 1978 <P> Foray worked for Hanna - Barbera , including on Tom and Jerry , Scooby - Doo , Where Are You ! , The Jetsons , The Flintstones and many other shows . In 1959 , she auditioned for the part of Betty Rubble on The Flintstones , but the part went to Bea Benaderet ; Foray described herself as `` terribly disappointed '' at not getting to play Betty . </P> <P> She did extensive voice acting for Stan Freberg 's commercials , albums , and 1957 radio series , memorably as secretary to the werewolf advertising executive . She also appeared in several Rankin / Bass TV specials in the 1960s and 1970s , voicing the young Karen and the teacher in the TV special Frosty the Snowman ( although only her Karen singing parts remained in later airings , after Rankin - Bass re-edited the special a few years after it debuted , with Foray 's dialogue re-dubbed by an actress who was uncredited ) . She also voiced all the female roles in Rikki - Tikki - Tavi ( 1975 ) , including the villainous cobra Nagaina . She played multiple characters on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show , including Natasha Fatale and Nell Fenwick , as well as male lead character Rocket J. Squirrel ( a.k.a. Rocky Squirrel ) for Jay Ward , and played Ursula on George of the Jungle ; and also starred on Fractured Flickers . </P> <P> In the mid-1960s , she became devoted to the preservation and promotion of animation and wrote numerous magazine articles about animation . She and a number of other animation artists had informal meetings around Hollywood in the 1960s , and later decided to formalize this as ASIFA - Hollywood , a chapter of the Association Internationale du Film d'Animation ( the International Animated Film Association ) . She is credited with coming up with the idea of the Annie Awards in 1972 , awarded by ASIFA - Hollywood , having noted that there had been no awards to celebrate the field of animation . In 1988 , she was awarded the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award . In 1995 , ASIFA - Hollywood established the June Foray Award , which is awarded to `` individuals who have made a significant and benevolent or charitable impact on the art and industry of animation '' . Foray was the first recipient of the award . In 2007 , Foray became a contributor to ASIFA - Hollywood 's Animation Archive Project . She also had sat on the Governors ' board for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences and lobbied for two decades for the Academy to establish an Academy Award for animation ; the Academy created the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2001 from her petitioning . </P> <P> In 2007 , Britt Irvin became the first person ever to voice a character in a cartoon remake that had been previously played by Foray in the original series when she voiced Ursula in the new George of the Jungle series on Cartoon Network . In 2011 , Roz Ryan voiced Witch Lezah ( Hazel spelled backwards ) in The Looney Tunes Show , opposite June Foray as Granny . </P> <P> Foray also voiced May Parker in Spider - Man and His Amazing Friends from 1981 - 1983 , as well as Raggedy Ann on several TV movies , Grandma Howard on Teen Wolf , Jokey Smurf and Mother Nature on The Smurfs , and Magica De Spell and Ma Beagle in DuckTales .

The attack , also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor , led to the United States ' entry into World War II . The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , and as Operation Z during its planning . </P> <P> Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S. - held Philippines , Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong . </P> <P> The attack commenced at 7 : 48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 18 : 18 UTC ) . The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft ( including fighters , level and dive bombers , and torpedo bombers ) in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers . All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged , with four sunk . All but the USS Arizona were later raised , and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war . The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded . Important base installations such as the power station , dry dock , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) , were not attacked . Japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 64 servicemen killed . One Japanese sailor , Kazuo Sakamaki , was captured . </P> <P> The surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters . The following day , December 8 , the United States declared war on Japan , and several days later , on December 11 , Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy . Domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940 , disappeared . </P> <P> There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan , but the lack of any formal warning , particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7 , 1941 , `` a date which will live in infamy '' . Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning , the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background to conflict <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Diplomatic background </Li> <Li> 1.2 Military planning </Li> <Li> 1.3 Objectives </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Approach and attack <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Submarines </Li> <Li> 2.2 Japanese declaration of war </Li> <Li> 2.3 First wave composition </Li> <Li> 2.4 Second wave composition </Li> <Li> 2.5 American casualties and damage </Li> <Li> 2.6 Japanese losses </Li> <Li> 2.7 Possible third wave </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Ships lost or damaged <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Battleships </Li> <Li> 3.2 Ex-battleship ( target / AA training ship ) </Li> <Li> 3.3 Cruisers </Li> <Li> 3.4 Destroyers </Li> <Li> 3.5 Auxiliaries </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Salvage </Li> <Li> 5 Aftermath <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Niihau Incident </Li> <Li> 5.2 Strategic implications </Li> <Li> 5.3 Retrospective debate on American intelligence </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 In popular culture </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Background to conflict </H2> Main article : Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor <H3> Diplomatic background </H3> <P> War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation had been aware of ( and developed contingency plans for ) since the 1920s , though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until Japan 's 1931 invasion of Manchuria . Over the next decade , Japan continued to expand into China , leading to all - out war between those countries in 1937 . Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland ; the `` Southern Operation '' was designed to assist these efforts . </P> Pearl Harbor on October 30 , 1941 , looking southwest <P> From December 1937 , events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay , the Allison incident , and the Nanking Massacre ( the International Military Tribunal of the Far East concluded that more than 200,000 Chinese non-combatants were killed in indiscriminate massacres , though other estimates have ranged from 40,000 to more than 300,000 ) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan . Fearing Japanese expansion , the United States , the United Kingdom , and France provided loan assistance for war supply contracts to China . </P> <P> In 1940 , Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China . The United States halted shipments of airplanes , parts , machine tools , and aviation gasoline to Japan , which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act . The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step that Japan would likely consider a provocation , given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil . </P> <P> Early in 1941 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in San Diego and ordered a military buildup in the Philippines in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East . Because the Japanese high command was ( mistakenly ) certain that any attack on the UK 's Southeast Asian colonies , including Singapore , would bring the U.S. into war , a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference . An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners . The U.S. War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000 - man elite force . This was opposed by Douglas MacArthur , who felt that he would need a force ten times that size , and was never implemented . By 1941 , U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral Thomas Hart , commander of the Asiatic Fleet . </P> <P> The U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941 , following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the Fall of France , in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption . This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies , an oil - rich territory . On August 17 , Roosevelt warned Japan that the U.S. was prepared to take steps against Japan if it attacked `` neighboring countries '' . The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource - rich , European - controlled colonies of Southeast Asia . </P> <P> Japan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations . During these negotiations , Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina when peace was made with the Nationalist government , adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact , and not to discriminate in trade provided all other countries reciprocated . Washington rejected these proposals . Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to meet with Roosevelt , but Roosevelt insisted on coming to an agreement before any meeting . The U.S. ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting , warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoye government and peace in the Pacific . His recommendation was not acted upon . The Konoye government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military refused to agree to the withdrawal of all troops from China . </P> <P> Japan 's final proposal , on November 20 , offered to withdraw their forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia provided that the U.S. , the UK , and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan . The American counter-proposal of November 26 ( November 27 in Japan ) ( the Hull note ) required Japan to evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers . However the day before the Hull Note was delivered , on November 26 in Japan , the main Japanese attack fleet left port for Pearl Harbor . </P> <H3> Military planning </H3> <P> Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the `` Southern Resource Area '' ( the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally ) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , then commanding Japan 's Combined Fleet . He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters , including a threat to resign his command . Full - scale planning was underway by early spring 1941 , primarily by Rear Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka , with assistance from Captain Minoru Genda and Yamamoto 's Deputy Chief of Staff , Captain Kameto Kuroshima . The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively . </P> <P> Over the next several months , pilots were trained , equipment was adapted , and intelligence was collected . Despite these preparations , Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5 , after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter . Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1 , after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the `` Hull Note '' would `` destroy the fruits of the China incident , endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea . '' </P> <P> By late 1941 , many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent . A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52 % of Americans expected war with Japan , 27 % did not , and 21 % had no opinion . While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions , U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target ; instead , they expected the Philippines would be attacked first . This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes , as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south . They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time . </P> <H3> Objectives </H3> <P> The Japanese attack had several major aims . First , it intended to destroy important American fleet units , thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference . Second , it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson - Walsh Act erased any chance of victory . Third , to deliver a blow to America 's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific , battleships were chosen as the main targets , since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time . Finally , it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests , and would seek a compromise peace with Japan . </P> <P> Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages : the targeted ships would be in very shallow water , so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them ; and most of the crews would survive the attack , since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor . A further important disadvantage -- this of timing , and known to the Japanese -- was the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet 's aircraft carriers ( Enterprise , Lexington , and Saratoga ) . IJN top command was so imbued with Admiral Mahan 's `` Decisive battle '' doctrine -- especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships -- that , despite these concerns , Yamamoto decided to press ahead . </P> <P> Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short , victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor , especially the navy yard , oil tank farms , and submarine base , were ignored , since -- by their thinking -- the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt . </P> <H2> Approach and attack </H2> See also : Order of battle of the Attack on Pearl Harbor Route followed by the Japanese fleet to Pearl Harbor and back An Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter on the aircraft carrier Akagi <P> On November 26 , 1941 , a Japanese task force ( the Striking Force ) of six aircraft carriers -- Akagi , Kaga , Sōryū , Hiryū , Shōkaku , and Zuikaku -- departed northern Japan en route to a position northwest of Hawaii , intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor : 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol ( CAP ) , including nine fighters from the first wave . </P> <P> The first wave was to be the primary attack , while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second , with battleships as the third target . The first wave carried most of the weapons to attack capital ships , mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water . The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets ( battleships and aircraft carriers ) or , if these were not present , any other high value ships ( cruisers and destroyers ) . First wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets . Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to intercept the bombers , especially in the first wave . When the fighters ' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat . Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed , especially over U.S. airfields . </P> <P> Before the attack commenced , two reconnaissance aircraft launched from cruisers Chikuma and Tone were sent to scout over Oahu and Maui and report on U.S. fleet composition and location . Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the U.S. , and were not necessary . U.S. fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor was already known due to the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa . A report of the absence of the U.S. fleet in Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the fleet submarine I - 72 . Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force ( the Kidō Butai ) and Niihau , to detect any counterattack . </P> <H3> Submarines </H3> <P> Fleet submarines I - 16 , I - 18 , I - 20 , I - 22 , and I - 24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu . The five I - boats left Kure Naval District on November 25 , 1941 . On December 6 , they came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of the mouth of Pearl Harbor and launched their midget subs at about 01 : 00 on December 7 . At 03 : 42 Hawaiian Time , the minesweeper Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer Ward . The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor . However , Ward sank another midget submarine at 06 : 37 in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater . A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08 : 43 . </P> <P> A third midget submarine , Ha - 19 , grounded twice , once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu , where it was captured on December 8 . Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui , becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war . A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes . Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00 : 41 on December 8 claiming damage to one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor . </P> <P> In 1992 , 2000 , and 2001 , Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory 's submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor . The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war , including vehicles and landing craft . Both of its torpedoes were missing . This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser St. Louis at 10 : 04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor , and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer Helm at 08 : 21 . </P> <H3> Japanese declaration of war </H3> See also : Japanese war crimes <P> The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan , but this was not Admiral Yamamoto 's intention . He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end . However , the attack began before the notice could be delivered . Tokyo transmitted the 5000 - word notification ( commonly called the `` 14 - Part Message '' ) in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington . Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule ; in the event , it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began . ( In fact , U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it . ) The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war . While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated and that war might break out at any moment , it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations . A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan 's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8 , but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack . </P> <P> For decades , conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington . In 1999 , however , Takeo Iguchi , a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo , discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how , and indeed whether , to notify Washington of Japan 's intention to break off negotiations and start a war , including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying , `` ( O ) ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success . '' Of this , Iguchi said , `` The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war , or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations ... and they clearly prevailed . '' </P> <P> In any event , even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14 - Part Message before the beginning of the attack , it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war . The final two paragraphs of the message read : </P> <P> Thus the earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese - American relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost . </P> The Japanese Government regrets to have to notify hereby the American Government that in view of the attitude of the American Government it can not but consider that it is impossible to reach an agreement through further negotiations . <H3> First wave composition </H3> The Japanese attacked in two waves . The first wave was detected by U.S. Army radar at 136 nautical miles ( 252 km ) , but was misidentified as USAAF bombers arriving from the American mainland Top : A. Ford Island NAS B.

Six planes failed to launch due to technical difficulties . It included : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1st Group ( targets : battleships and aircraft carriers ) <Ul> <Li> 49 Nakajima B5N Kate bombers armed with 800 kg ( 1760 lb ) armor - piercing bombs , organized in four sections ( 1 failed to launch ) </Li> <Li> 40 B5N bombers armed with Type 91 torpedoes , also in four sections </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2nd Group -- ( targets : Ford Island and Wheeler Field ) <Ul> <Li> 51 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) general - purpose bombs ( 3 failed to launch ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3rd Group -- ( targets : aircraft at Ford Island , Hickam Field , Wheeler Field , Barber 's Point , Kaneohe ) <Ul> <Li> 43 Mitsubishi A6M `` Zero '' fighters for air control and strafing ( 2 failed to launch ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> As the first wave approached Oahu , it was detected by the U.S. Army SCR - 270 radar at Opana Point near the island 's northern tip . This post had been in training mode for months , but was not yet operational . The operators , Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard , reported a target . But Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler , a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center , presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B - 17 bombers from California . The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close ( only a few degrees difference ) to the bombers , and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar , they neglected to tell Tyler of its size . Tyler , for security reasons , could not tell the operators of the six B - 17s that were due ( even though it was widely known ) . </P> <P> As the first wave planes approached Oahu , they encountered and shot down several U.S. aircraft . At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning . Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing . Nevertheless , it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly . The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor , though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked Pearl Harbor . </P> <P> The air portion of the attack began at 7 : 48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 3 : 18 a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time , as kept by ships of the Kido Butai ) , with the attack on Kaneohe . A total of 353 Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu . Slow , vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave , exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present ( the battleships ) , while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across Oahu , starting with Hickam Field , the largest , and Wheeler Field , the main U.S. Army Air Forces fighter base . The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces ' Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island , and Ford Island . The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P - 36 Hawks , P - 40 Warhawks , and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Enterprise . </P> A destroyed Vindicator at Ewa field , the victim of one of the smaller attacks on the approach to Pearl Harbor <P> In the first wave attack , about eight of the forty - nine 800 kg ( 1760 lb ) armor - piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets . At least two of those bombs broke up on impact , another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck , and one was a dud . Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships , and four torpedoes hit other ships . Men aboard U.S. ships awoke to the sounds of alarms , bombs exploding , and gunfire , prompting bleary - eyed men to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations . ( The famous message , `` Air raid Pearl Harbor . This is not drill . '' , was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two , the first senior Hawaiian command to respond . ) The defenders were very unprepared . Ammunition lockers were locked , aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage , guns unmanned ( none of the Navy 's 5 `` / 38s , only a quarter of its machine guns , and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action ) . Despite this low alert status , many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack . Ensign Joe Taussig Jr. , aboard Nevada , commanded the ship 's antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded , but continued to be on post . Lt. Commander F.J. Thomas commanded Nevada in the captain 's absence and got her under way until the ship was grounded at 9 : 10 a.m. One of the destroyers , Aylwin , got underway with only four officers aboard , all ensigns , none with more than a year 's sea duty ; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard . Captain Mervyn Bennion , commanding West Virginia , led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit Tennessee , moored alongside . </P> <H3> Second wave composition </H3> <P> The second planned wave consisted of 171 planes : 54 B5Ns , 81 D3As , and 36 A6Ms , commanded by Lieutenant - Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki . Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties . This wave and its targets comprised : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1st Group -- 54 B5Ns armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) and 132 lb ( 60 kg ) general - purpose bombs <Ul> <Li> 27 B5Ns -- aircraft and hangars on Kaneohe , Ford Island , and Barbers Point </Li> <Li> 27 B5Ns -- hangars and aircraft on Hickam Field </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2nd Group ( targets : aircraft carriers and cruisers ) <Ul> <Li> 78 D3As armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) general - purpose bombs , in four sections ( 3 aborted ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3rd Group -- ( targets : aircraft at Ford Island , Hickam Field , Wheeler Field , Barber 's Point , Kaneohe ) <Ul> <Li> 35 A6Ms for defense and strafing ( 1 aborted ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> The second wave was divided into three groups . One was tasked to attack Kāne ʻohe , the rest Pearl Harbor proper . The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions . </P> <H3> American casualties and damage </H3> <P> Ninety minutes after it began , the attack was over . 2,008 sailors were killed and 710 others wounded ; 218 soldiers and airmen ( who were part of the Army until the independent U.S. Air Force was formed in 1947 ) were killed and 364 wounded ; 109 marines were killed and 69 wounded ; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded . In total , 2,403 Americans died and 1,178 were wounded . Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground , including five battleships . All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were non-combatants , given the fact there was no state of war when the attack occurred . </P> USS Arizona during the attack USS Nevada , on fire and down at the bow , attempting to leave the harbor before being deliberately beached <P> Of the American fatalities , nearly half were due to the explosion of Arizona 's forward magazine after it was hit by a modified 16 - inch ( 410 mm ) shell . </P> <P> Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships , Nevada attempted to exit the harbor . She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250 lb ( 113 kg ) bombs , which started further fires . She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance . </P> <P> California was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes . The crew might have kept her afloat , but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps . Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia drifted down on her , and probably made the situation look worse than it was . The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes . West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes , the seventh tearing away her rudder . Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes , the last two above her belt armor , which caused her to capsize . Maryland was hit by two of the converted 16 '' shells , but neither caused serious damage . </P> <P> Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships ( the largest vessels present ) , they did not ignore other targets . The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed , and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala . Two destroyers in dry dock , Cassin and Downes were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers . The leaking fuel caught fire ; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise , and both were burned out . Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes . The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo . The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged , but remained in service . The repair vessel Vestal , moored alongside Arizona , was heavily damaged and beached . The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged . The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine . </P> This message denotes the first U.S. ship , St. Louis to clear Pearl Harbor . ( National Archives and Records Administration ) ( Note that this is in answer to question `` Is channel clear ? '' and faint writing at bottom concerning the answer being held until St. Louis had successfully cleared . ) <P> Of the 402 American aircraft in Hawaii , 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged , 155 of them on the ground . Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base . Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack : 1st Lt. Lewis M. Sanders , 2nd Lt. Philip M. Rasmussen , 2nd Lt. Kenneth M. Taylor , 2nd Lt. George S. Welch , 2nd Lt. Harry W. Brown , and 2nd Lt. Gordon H. Sterling Jr . Sterling was shot down by Lt. Fujita over Kaneohe Bay and is listed as Body Not Recovered ( not Missing In Action ) . Lt. John L. Dains was killed by friendly fire returning from a victory over Kaawa . Of 33 PBYs in Hawaii , 24 were destroyed , and six others damaged beyond repair . ( The three on patrol returned undamaged . ) Friendly fire brought down some U.S. planes on top of that , including five from an inbound flight from Enterprise . Japanese attacks on barracks killed additional personnel . </P> <P> At the time of the attack , nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor . Of these , three were shot down . </P> <H3> Japanese losses </H3> <P> Fifty - five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack , and one was captured . Of Japan 's 414 available planes , 29 were lost during the battle ( nine in the first attack wave , 20 in the second ) , with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground . </P> <H3> Possible third wave </H3> <P> Several Japanese junior officers including Fuchida and Genda urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor 's fuel and torpedo storage , maintenance , and dry dock facilities as possible . Genda , who had unsuccessfully advocated for invading Hawaii after the air attack , believed that without an invasion three strikes were necessary to disable the base as much as possible . The captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike . Military historians have suggested the destruction of these shore facilities would have hampered the U.S. Pacific Fleet far more seriously than the loss of its battleships . If they had been wiped out , `` serious ( American ) operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year '' ; according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet , `` it would have prolonged the war another two years . '' Nagumo , however , decided to withdraw for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> American anti-aircraft performance had improved considerably during the second strike , and two thirds of Japan 's losses were incurred during the second wave . </Li> <Li> Nagumo felt if he launched a third strike , he would be risking three quarters of the Combined Fleet 's strength to wipe out the remaining targets ( which included the facilities ) while suffering higher aircraft losses . </Li> <Li> The location of the American carriers remained unknown . In addition , the admiral was concerned his force was now within range of American land - based bombers . Nagumo was uncertain whether the U.S. had enough surviving planes remaining on Hawaii to launch an attack against his carriers . </Li> <Li> A third wave would have required substantial preparation and turnaround time , and would have meant returning planes would have had to land at night . At the time , only the Royal Navy had developed night carrier techniques , so this was a substantial risk . </Li> <Li> The task force 's fuel situation did not permit him to remain in waters north of Pearl Harbor much longer , since he was at the very limit of logistical support . To do so risked running unacceptably low on fuel , perhaps even having to abandon destroyers en route home . </Li> <Li> He believed the second strike had essentially satisfied the main objective of his mission -- the neutralization of the Pacific Fleet -- and did not wish to risk further losses . Moreover , it was Japanese Navy practice to prefer the conservation of strength over the total destruction of the enemy . </Li> </Ul> <P> At a conference aboard Yamato the following morning , Yamamoto initially supported Nagumo . In retrospect , sparing the vital dockyards , maintenance shops , and oil depots meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific . Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo 's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike . </P> <H2> Ships lost or damaged </H2> <P> Seventeen ships were damaged or lost in the attack , of which fourteen were repaired and returned to service . </P> <H3> Battleships </H3> <Ul> <Li> Arizona ( RADM Kidd 's flagship of Battleship Division One ) : hit by four armor - piercing bombs , exploded ; total loss . 1,177 dead . </Li> <Li> Oklahoma : hit by five torpedoes , capsized ; total loss . 429 dead . </Li> <Li> West Virginia : hit by two bombs , seven torpedoes , sunk ; returned to service July 1944 . 106 dead . </Li> <Li> California : hit by two bombs , two torpedoes , sunk ; returned to service January 1944 . 100 dead . </Li> <Li> Nevada : hit by six bombs , one torpedo , beached ; returned to service October 1942 . 60 dead . </Li> <Li> Pennsylvania ( ADM Kimmel 's flagship of the United States Pacific Fleet ) : in drydock with Cassin and Downes , hit by one bomb and debris from USS Cassin ; remained in service . 9 dead . </Li> <Li> Tennessee : hit by two bombs ; returned to service February 1942 . 5 dead . </Li> <Li> Maryland : hit by two bombs ; returned to service February 1942 . 4 dead ( including floatplane pilot shot down ) . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Ex-battleship ( target / aa training ship ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Utah : hit by two torpedoes , capsized ; total loss . 64 dead . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Cruisers </H3> <Ul> <Li> Helena : hit by one torpedo ; returned to service January 1942 . 20 dead . </Li> <Li> Raleigh : hit by one torpedo ; returned to service February 1942 . </Li> <Li> Honolulu : Near miss , light damage ; remained in service . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Destroyers </H3> <Ul> <Li> Cassin : in drydock with Downes and Pennsylvania , hit by one bomb , burned ; returned to service February 1944 . </Li> <Li> Downes : in drydock with Cassin and Pennsylvania , caught fire from Cassin , burned ; returned to service November 1943 . </Li> <Li> Shaw : hit by three bombs ; returned to service June 1942 . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Auxiliaries </H3> <Ul> <Li> Oglala ( minelayer ) : Damaged by torpedo hit on Helena , capsized ; returned to service ( as engine - repair ship ) February 1944 . </Li> <Li> Vestal ( repair ship ) : hit by two bombs , blast and fire from Arizona , beached ; returned to service by August 1942 . </Li> <Li> Curtiss ( seaplane tender ) : hit by one bomb , one crashed Japanese aircraft ; returned to service January 1942 . 19 dead . </Li> <Li> Sotoyomo ( harbor tug ) : damaged by explosion and fires in Shaw ; sunk ; returned to service August 1942 . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Salvage </H2> Captain Homer N. Wallin ( center ) supervises salvage operations aboard USS California , early 1942 <P> After a systematic search for survivors , formal salvage operations began . Captain Homer N. Wallin , Material Officer for Commander , Battle Force , U.S. Pacific Fleet , was immediately ordered to lead salvage operations . `` Within a short time I was relieved of all other duties and ordered to full time work as Fleet Salvage Officer . '' </P> <P> Around Pearl Harbor , divers from the Navy ( shore and tenders ) , the Naval Shipyard , and civilian contractors ( Pacific Bridge and others ) began work on the ships that could be refloated . They patched holes , cleared debris , and pumped water out of ships . Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships . Within six months , five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair . </P> <P> Intensive salvage operations continued for another year , a total of some 20,000 man - hours under water . Oklahoma , while successfully raised , was never repaired , and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947 . Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage , though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels . Today , the two hulks remain where they were sunk , with Arizona becoming a war memorial . </P> <H2> Aftermath </H2> Main article : Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor U.S. President Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan on December 8 , 1941 <P> In the wake of the attack , 15 Medals of Honor , 51 Navy Crosses , 53 Silver Stars , four Navy and Marine Corps Medals , one Distinguished Flying Cross , four Distinguished Service Crosses , one Distinguished Service Medal , and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor . Additionally , a special military award , the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal , was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack . </P> <P> The day after the attack , Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress , calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan . Congress obliged his request less than an hour later . On December 11 , Germany and Italy declared war on the United States , even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it . Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day . The UK actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the U.S. did , partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya , Singapore and Hong Kong , and partially due to Winston Churchill 's promise to declare war `` within the hour '' of a Japanese attack on the United States . </P> Pennsylvania , behind the wreckage of Downes and Cassin <P> The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater . Further losses compounded the alarming setback . Japan attacked the Philippines hours later ( because of the time difference , it was December 8 in the Philippines ) . Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor , the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya , causing British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later to recollect `` In all the war I never received a more direct shock . As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me . There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California . Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked '' . </P> Remember December 7th ! propaganda issued in 1942 <P> Throughout the war , Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda . </P> <P> One further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath ( notably the Niihau incident ) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese - American internment camps . Within hours of the attack , hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high - security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii . Eventually , more than 110,000 Japanese Americans , nearly all who lived on the West Coast , were forced into interior camps , but in Hawaii , where the 150,000 - plus Japanese Americans composed over one - third of the population , only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned . </P> <P> The attack also had international consequences . The Canadian province of British Columbia , bordering the Pacific Ocean , had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese Canadian descendants . Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack , leading to a reaction from the Government of Canada . On February 24 , 1942 , Order - in - Council P.C. no . 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia , as well as the prohibiting from them returning to the province . On 4 March , regulations under the Act were adopted to evacuate Japanese - Canadians . As a result , 12,000 were interned in interior camps , 2,000 were sent to road camps and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies at sugar beet farms . </P> Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi 's aircraft shown ten days after it crashed <H3> Niihau incident </H3> Main article : Niihau incident <P> The Japanese planners had determined that some means was required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers . The island of Niihau , only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor , was designated as the rescue point . </P> <P> The Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler , so he flew to the rescue point on Niihau . The aircraft was further damaged on landing . Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians , who , aware of the tension between the United States and Japan , took the pilot 's maps and other documents . The island 's residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor . Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese - American residents in an attempt to recover the documents . During the ensuing struggles , Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded ; one collaborator committed suicide , and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison . </P> <P> The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many , and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted . </P> <H3> Strategic implications </H3> <P> Admiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying , `` We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war . '' To a similar effect , see Isoroku Yamamoto 's alleged `` sleeping giant '' quote . </P> <P> While the attack accomplished its intended objective , it turned out to be largely unnecessary . Unbeknownst to Yamamoto , who conceived the original plan , the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon ' charging ' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war ( in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange ) . The U.S. instead adopted `` Plan Dog '' in 1940 , which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia , while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany . </P> <P> Fortunately for the United States , the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack ; otherwise the Pacific Fleet 's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more ( given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet ) . As it was , the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines -- the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance . While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service , their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment , and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles ( their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944 ) . A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships , in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan . As a result , Yamamoto ( and his successors ) hoarded battleships for a `` decisive battle '' that never happened . </P> <P> The Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short , victorious war meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor 's navy repair yards , oil tank farms , submarine base , and old headquarters building . All of these targets were omitted from Genda 's list , yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war efforts in the Pacific . The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support to the U.S. Navy 's operations , such as the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway . It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy 's heavy ships and brought Japan 's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials : by the end of 1942 , import of raw materials was cut to half of what it had been , `` to a disastrous ten million tons '' , while oil import `` was almost completely stopped '' . Lastly , the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force 's success . </P> <H3> Retrospective debate on American intelligence </H3> Main article : Pearl Harbor advance - knowledge conspiracy theory <P> Ever since the Japanese attack , there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware , and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics . Military officers including Gen. Billy Mitchell had pointed out the vulnerability of Pearl to air attack . At least two Naval War games , one in 1932 and another in 1936 , proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack . Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt 's decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor . The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings has contributed to conspiracy theories . Several writers , including journalist Robert Stinnett and former United States rear admiral Robert Alfred Theobald , have argued that various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the U.S. into war via the so - called `` back door '' . However , this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians . </P> <H2> In popular culture </H2> Main article : Attack on Pearl Harbor in popular culture <H2> See also </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Battle of Taranto </Li> <Li> Operation K </Li> <Li> Air warfare of World War II </Li> <Li> Attack on Howland Island </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> List of United States Navy ships present at Pearl Harbor , December 7 , 1941 </Li> <Li> List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Attack on Pearl Harbor </Li> <Li> Nagai Kita </Li> <Li> Edwin T.

There is , however , no doubt that they did know , as did the Japanese . Lt. Cdr .

Mitsuo Fuchida about his observations . Fuchida led the Japanese attack on December 7 , 1941 . '' </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` A torpedo bomber needed a long , level flight , and when released , its conventional torpedo would plunge nearly a hundred feet deep before swerving upward to strike a hull . Pearl Harbor deep averages 42 feet . But the Japanese borrowed an idea from the British carrier - based torpedo raid on the Italian naval base of Taranto . They fashioned auxiliary wooden tail fins to keep the torpedoes horizontal , so they would dive to only 35 feet , and they added a breakaway `` nosecone '' of soft wood to cushion the impact with the surface of the water .

The series , which would be set in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans , would follow Cloak and Dagger as the two `` find each other and realize that their powers both complement and complicate their lives . '' Around this time , Loeb had a meeting with ABC Family , who recommended Joe Pokaski to Loeb as a potential writer to work with Marvel Television , based on a script for another series the channel had recently received from Pokaski . Loeb reached out to Pokaski about working with Marvel , who was interested in writing Cloak and Dagger since `` there 's something that felt so right about them for the television format '' , and wrote the script . Pokaski was attracted to Cloak and Dagger as a television series , because the duo are the only people who understand each other 's situations , compared to other coming - of - age teenage television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Smallville where the main characters have no one who can relate to them . </P> <P> In April 2016 , the series received a straight - to - series order for Freeform , the new name of ABC Family , from ABC Signature Studios and Marvel Television . By August 2016 , Pokaski had signed on to the series as showrunner and executive producer . Pokaski noted his script had `` sat in a drawer for five years '' , before Freeform executive Karey Burke found it and `` took a chance on it '' . Loeb , Jim Chory , Alan Fine , Stan Lee , Joe Quesada , and Karim Zreik also serve as executive producers , while Jenny Klein produces the series . </P> <P> On July 20 , 2018 , Freeform renewed the series for a 10 - episode second season . </P> <H3> Writing ( edit ) </H3> ... ( I ) t all starts with representation ... ( W ) e make sure our writers room is filled with as many people who do not look like me as possible . We have really good writers who allow ourselves a wide enough berth to have real conversations and find the truth across our experiences . That 's the key ; it 's what people talk about a lot but we try to actually execute it . <P> -- Showrunner Joe Pokaski on having diversity in the series ' writers and the issues the series can explore . </P> <P> When announcing the series , Freeform called it their `` first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe '' , and described it as a `` superhero love story '' , a premise that Variety called `` a seamless fit for Freeform '' given the channel 's target audience of `` Becomers '' ( the 14 -- 34 age demographic ) . Addressing this , Loeb said , `` It 's a love story that happens to have characters that have always traditionally been in that age group . It 's not like we took something and made it into a ( young adult fiction ( YA ) ) . It speaks to a YA audience and is a YA property . Would I do Punisher on Freeform ? I do n't think that 's going to connect the same way . '' Pokaski was pleased with the diversity of the writers for the first season , with a majority of black writers and many female writers . The majority of the writers from the first season returned for the second. The second season would explore the themes of women 's rights and issues through Mina Hess , while `` continuing to drive the conversation forward about race in America '' . </P> <P> Pokaski spoke about the differences in Cloak and Dagger 's origin story from the comics , saying , `` I think the original ( comic ) stories were fantastic , but for the time , while they were a little progressive , they were a little bit sexist and racist once you got into it , for now . What we tried to do was deconstruct it and make it about Tandy and Tyrone , understand who they were . '' Since the original comics `` are a little dated '' , Pokaski and the writers could to make adjustments accordingly as Cloak and Dagger do not have an established comics mythology , making sure `` we were telling the right story for now '' . He also felt Loeb 's idea of having the duo live in New Orleans , opposed to New York City as in the comics , was a `` great idea '' . Since Marvel was also developing The Defenders at the same time , moving to the New Orleans setting `` came up pretty early '' , since Pokaski felt New York City of the Marvel Cinematic Universe had enough superheroes . When looking for alternate locations , and considering places with filming tax incentives , New Orleans `` felt so right for Tandy and Tyrone . It felt gothic , it felt a little bit dark , it felt like a place of light and shadow . The more we learned about the city and about its history and about voudon or the Mardi Gras Indians , it felt like it was the only place for Tandy and Tyrone to start . '' </P> <P> Pokaski did not want to rush the romantic relationship between the duo in the first season , and hoped the series would last long enough to allow for `` an interesting path to their relationship . '' Pokaski has an intent to create 100 episodes for the series , with `` a definitive plan for five season '' created . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph at WonderCon 2018 promoting Cloak & Dagger <P> In January 2017 , it was announced that Olivia Holt and Aubrey Joseph had been cast as Tandy Bowen / Dagger and Tyrone Johnson / Cloak , respectively . Gina Prince - Bythewood , the director of the first episode , called the casting process `` really , really tough ... it was three days before we were supposed to leave ( to begin filming ) and we did n't find ( actors for Tandy and Tyrone ) . People started getting willing to settle and the people that were on the table were 27 , 28 . They felt grown and it did n't feel right for the show . Then Aubrey and Olivia walked in the door , and they had such great chops individually '' . </P> <P> The following month , Andrea Roth was cast as Melissa Bowen , Tandy 's mother ; Gloria Reuben and Miles Mussenden were cast as Tyrone 's parents , Adina and Otis Johnson ; and Carl Lundstedt and J.D. Evermore were cast as Liam Walsh and Connors , respectively . Emma Lahana and Jaime Zevallos also star as Brigid O'Reilly and Delgado . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Filming for the series takes place in New Orleans , with the first season using the working title Shadows . The first season features many hand - held camera shots that established the `` look and feel '' of the series , in part because Pokaski `` did n't want to wait for a dolly track to be laid '' . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mark Isham announced in May 2017 that he would compose the music for the series . Multiple songs are featured throughout the first season , some of which were collected and released on a digital soundtrack album on June 8 , 2018 , by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records . An album featuring Isham 's score was released digitally on July 6 . </P> <H3> Marvel Cinematic Universe tie - ins ( edit ) </H3> <P> Freeform executive Karey Burke said in April 2017 that the series is `` not particularly connected '' to New Warriors , which was slated to air on Freeform at the time , given `` their tones are so wildly different '' , adding , `` There are many degrees of separation with where they fall in the Marvel universe . But anything is possible with Marvel . '' In July , Loeb said there were no plans to crossover , nor to crossover across networks with the similarly themed Marvel 's Runaways on Hulu . He added that Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe , saying `` You 'll see things that comment on each other ; we try to touch base wherever we can ... things that are happening in L.A. ( where Runaways is set ) are not exactly going to be affecting what 's happening in New Orleans ... It 's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense . '' </P> <P> Ahead of the series premiere , considering the larger events of the MCU at that point , Pokaski said he was `` not allowed to talk about '' how the series would connect to the events of Avengers : Infinity War but stated `` We 've had some exciting conversations about how we could artfully cross Tandy and Tyrone over ( to other Marvel properties ) . The beauty of these two is that they can show up anywhere ( and it makes sense ) . '' After the first season finale , Pokaski expanded , saying he would `` love '' to have Tandy and Tyrone appear in the MCU films `` as utility players the way they are in comics '' , but conceded `` there are a lot of legal hurdles and corporate barriers to doing that '' . Regarding a crossover with the Runaways , Pokaski noted `` there 's hopefully there 's some karma we can fulfill there '' since the duo in the comics appear early in the Runaways comic series . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Season </Th> <Th> Episodes </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Originally aired </Th> <Th_colspan=\"3\"> DVD and Blu - ray release dates </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> First aired </Th> <Th> Last aired </Th> <Th> Region 1 </Th> <Th> Region 2 </Th> <Th> Region 4 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> 10 </Td> <Td> June 7 , 2018 ( 2018 - 06 - 07 ) </Td> <Td> August 2 , 2018 ( 2018 - 08 - 02 ) </Td> <Td> TBA </Td> <Td> TBA </Td> <Td> TBA </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> 10 </Td> <Td> Early 2019 </Td> <Td> TBD </Td> <Td> TBA </Td> <Td> TBA </Td> <Td> TBA </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Cloak & Dagger airs in the United States on Freeform and on ABC Spark in Canada , while Amazon Video airs the series in the United Kingdom and select additional European countries . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Season </Th> <Th_colspan=\"5\"> Nielsen ratings </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Critical response </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Premiere total viewers ( in millions ) </Th> <Th> Finale total viewers ( in millions ) </Th> <Th> Season average total viewers , inc .

After three days , `` First Light '' had 1.64 million total viewers , which was a 78 % increase from its initial viewers , the largest three - day lift for any Freeform debut . `` First Light '' also had the biggest digital debut ever for the network , with 716,000 starts . The premiere drew 7.3 million views across linear and digital platforms and was Thursday 's most - social scripted series with 112,000 engagements across Twitter , Instagram , Facebook and Tumblr . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> For the first season , the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 90 % approval rating with an average rating of 7.77 / 10 based on 41 reviews . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Cloak & Dagger blends soapy drama with superhero grit to create an exciting , surprisingly thoughtful addition to the genre -- even if it falls prey to a certain amount of narrative bloat . '' Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 15 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . </P> <H3> Analysis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Upon the announcement of the series , Riesman felt one of the show 's potential strengths was the fact that Marvel had a unique opportunity to tell a story `` without needing to appeal to any kind of rabid fanbase or honor any iconic stories , '' because the characters have neither `` any famous archnemeses , '' nor `` a widely read graphic novel '' that fans would be expecting to see . He concluded saying , `` Cloak & Dagger could be something unique and potentially lovely : an attempt to build a new bit of filmed superhero iconography ( mostly ) from the ground up . There 's so much to mine in this genre . It deals metaphorically with the burdens , risks , and liberations of power -- and it has the storytelling freedoms offered by high - concept science fiction , fantasy , and magical realism . '' Pokaski would later tell Riesman in August 2018 that he sent Karey Burke and other executives on the series Riseman 's article as encouragement for the direction they were planning to take the series and to know what they released about the series at the time did not sound `` like we were blowing smoke '' . </P> <H3> Accolades ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Category </Th> <Th> Recipient ( s ) </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref ( s ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> Teen Choice Awards </Td> <Td> Choice Summer TV Show </Td> <Td> Cloak & Dagger </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Summer TV Star </Td> <Td> Olivia Holt </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Aubrey Joseph </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Wagmeister , Elizabeth ( April 7 , 2016 ) . `` Freeform Greenlights Marvel Romance Superhero Series ' Cloak and Dagger ' ( EXCLUSIVE ) '' .

The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World . In the Soviet Union 's seventy - year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office , but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) . In the ideology of Vladimir Lenin , the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the vanguard party ( see What Is To Be Done ? ) . </P> <P> Following Joseph Stalin 's consolidation of power in the 1920s , the post of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with leader of the Soviet Union because the post controlled both the Communist Party and the Soviet Government . The post of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary . In 1966 , Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name . Being the head of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) , the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990 . The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession , so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo , the Central Committee , or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power . The President of the Soviet Union , an office created in March 1990 , replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office . </P> <P> Contemporaneously to establishment of the office of the President , representatives of the Congress of People 's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet Constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one - party state controlled by the Communist Party which in turn played the leading role in society . This vote weakened the party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people . Upon death , resignation , or removal from office of an incumbent President , the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office , though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested . After the failed August coup , the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Summary </Li> <Li> 2 List of leaders </Li> <Li> 3 List of troikas </Li> <Li> 4 Statistics </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Summary ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> This article is part of a series on the </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Politics of the Soviet Union </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Leadership ( show ) <Ul> <Li> Leaders </Li> <Li> President <Ul> <Li> ( list </Li> <Li> Vice President ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Collective leadership </Li> <Li> State Council </Li> <Li> Presidential Council </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Communist Party ( show ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Congress </Li> <Li> Central Committee </Li> <Li> History </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> General Secretary </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Politburo </Li> <Li> Secretariat </Li> <Li> Orgburo </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Legislature ( show ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Congress of Soviets ( Central Executive Committee ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Supreme Soviet </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Soviet of the Union </Li> <Li> Soviet of Nationalities </Li> <Li> Presidium </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Congress of People 's Deputies </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> <Ul> <Li> Speaker </Li> <Li> 1989 Legislative election </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Governance ( show ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Constitution </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Official names </Li> <Li> 1924 </Li> <Li> 1936 </Li> <Li> 1977 </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Government </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Ministries </Li> <Li> State Committees </Li> <Li> Executive Officer </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Premiership </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Cabinets </Li> <Li> Council of People 's Commissars </Li> <Li> Council of Ministers </Li> <Li> Cabinet of Ministers </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Judiciary ( show ) <Ul> <Li> Law </Li> <Li> Supreme Court <Ul> <Li> Military Collegium </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> People 's Court </Li> <Li> Procurator General </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ideology ( show ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Soviet democracy </Li> <Li> Marxism -- Leninism </Li> <Li> <Ul> <Li> Leninism </Li> <Li> Stalinism </Li> <Li> Khrushchevism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> De-Stalinization </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Society ( show ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Economy </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Agriculture </Li> <Li> Consumer goods </Li> <Li> Five - Year Plan </Li> <Li> Kosygin reform </Li> <Li> New Economic Policy </Li> <Li> Science and technology </Li> <Li> Era of Stagnation </Li> <Li> Material balance planning </Li> <Li> Transport </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Culture </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Demographics </Li> <Li> Education </Li> <Li> Family </Li> <Li> Phraseology </Li> <Li> Religion </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Repression </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Censorship </Li> <Li> Censorship of images </Li> <Li> Great Purge </Li> <Li> Gulag system </Li> <Li> Collectivization </Li> <Li> Human rights </Li> <Li> Ideological repression </Li> <Li> Suppressed research </Li> <Li> Political abuse of psychiatry </Li> <Li> Political repression </Li> <Li> Population transfer </Li> <Li> Propaganda </Li> <Li> Red Terror </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Other countries </Li> <Li> Atlas </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Vladimir Lenin was voted the Chairman of the Council of People 's Commissars of the Soviet Union ( Sovnarkom ) on 30 December 1922 by the Congress of Soviets . At the age of 53 , his health declined from effects of two bullet wounds , later aggravated by three strokes which culminated with his death in 1924 . Irrespective of his health status in his final days , Lenin was already losing much of his power to Joseph Stalin . Alexei Rykov succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom and although he was de jure the most powerful person in the country , the Politburo of the Communist Party began to overshadow the Sovnarkom in the mid-1920s . By the end of the decade , Rykov merely rubber stamped the decisions predetermined by Stalin and the Politburo . </P> <P> Stalin 's early policies pushed for rapid industrialisation , nationalisation of private industry and the collectivisation of private plots created under Lenin 's New Economic Policy . As leader of the Politburo , Stalin consolidated near - absolute power by 1938 after the Great Purge , a series of campaigns of political murder , repression and persecution . Nazi German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , but by December the Soviet Army managed to stop the attack just shy of Moscow . On Stalin 's orders , the Soviet Union launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany which finally succeeded in 1945 . Stalin died in March 1953 and his death triggered a power struggle in which Nikita Khrushchev after several years emerged victorious against Georgy Malenkov . </P> <P> Khrushchev denounced Stalin on two occasions , first in 1956 and then in 1962 . His policy of de-Stalinisation earned him many enemies within the party , especially from old Stalinist appointees . Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising . A group known as Anti-Party Group tried to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957 , but it failed . As Khrushchev grew older , his erratic behavior became worse , usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo . Leonid Brezhnev , a close companion of Khrushchev , was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev 's removal from power . Alexei Kosygin became the new Premier and Anastas Mikoyan kept his office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet . On the orders of the Politburo , Mikoyan was forced to retire in 1965 and Nikolai Podgorny took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium . The Soviet Union in the post-Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a collective leadership . Henry A. Kissinger , the American National Security Advisor , mistakenly believed that Kosygin was the leader of the Soviet Union and that he was at the helm of Soviet foreign policy because he represented the Soviet Union at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference . The `` Era of Stagnation '' , a derogatory term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev , was a period marked by low socio - economic efficiency in the country and a gerontocracy ruling the country . Yuri Andropov ( aged 68 at the time ) succeeded Brezhnev in his post as General Secretary in 1982 . In 1983 , Andropov was hospitalised and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health . Nikolai Tikhonov usually chaired the meetings in his place . Following Andropov 's death fifteen months after his appointment , an even older leader , 72 year old Konstantin Chernenko , was elected to the General Secretariat . His rule lasted for little more than a year until his death thirteen months later on 10 March 1985 . </P> <P> At the age of 54 , Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the General Secretariat by the Politburo on 11 March 1985 . In May 1985 , Gorbachev publicly admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequate living standards , being the first Soviet leader to do so while also beginning a series of fundamental reforms . From 1986 to around 1988 , he dismantled central planning , allowed state enterprises to set their own outputs , enabled private investment in businesses not previously permitted to be privately owned and allowed foreign investment , among other measures . He also opened up the management of and decision - making within the Soviet Union and allowed greater public discussion and criticism , along with a warming of relationships with the West . These twin policies were known as perestroika ( literally meaning `` reconstruction '' , but it varies ) and glasnost ( `` openness '' and `` transparency '' ) , respectively . The dismantling of the principal defining features of Soviet Communism in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union led to the unintended consequence of the Soviet Union breaking up after the failed August coup of 1991 led by Gennady Yanayev . </P> <H2> List of leaders ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following list includes only those persons who held the top leadership position of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ( CPSU ) from its founding in 1922 until the party 's demise as the official `` leading power '' of the Union in 1991 and in the few months aftwerward , lead the government . † denotes leaders who died in office . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name ( Birth -- Death ) </Th> <Th> Portrait </Th> <Th> Period </Th> <Th> Congress </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Vladimir Lenin ( 1870 -- 1924 ) </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> 30 December 1922 ↓ 21 January 1924 † </Td> <Td> 11th -- 12th Congress </Td> <Td> Chairman of the Council of People 's Commissars ( Sovnarkom ) and informal leader of the Bolsheviks since their inception .

At the most fiery session since the so - called `` anti-party group '' crisis of 1957 , he was fired from all his posts . He was largely left in peace in retirement , but he was made a `` non-person '' to the extent that his name was removed even from the thirty - volume Soviet Encyclopedia . He died in 1971 .

The troika consisted of Lev Kamenev , Joseph Stalin and Grigory Zinoviev . The troika broke up in April 1925 , when Kamenev and Zinoviev found themselves in a minority over their belief that socialism could only be achieved internationally . Zinoviev and Kamenev joined forces with Leon Trotsky 's Left Opposition in early 1926 .

It stars Jane Fonda , Lily Tomlin , and Dolly Parton as three working women who live out their fantasies of getting even with , and their overthrow of , the company 's autocratic , `` sexist , egotistical , lying , hypocritical bigot '' boss , played by Dabney Coleman . </P> <P> The film grossed over $103.9 million and is the 20th highest - grossing comedy film . As a star vehicle for Parton -- already established as a successful singer , musician and songwriter -- it launched her permanently into mainstream popular culture . A television series of the same name based on the film ran for five seasons , and a musical version of the film ( also titled 9 to 5 ) , with new songs written by Parton , opened on Broadway on April 30 , 2009 . </P> <P> 9 to 5 is number 74 on the American Film Institute 's `` 100 Funniest Movies '' and has an 82 % approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production </Li> <Li> 4 Filming locations </Li> <Li> 5 Theme song </Li> <Li> 6 Television series </Li> <Li> 7 2009 Broadway musical </Li> <Li> 8 Possible sequel </Li> <Li> 9 Accolades </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Judy Bernly ( Jane Fonda ) is forced to find work after her husband , Dick ( Lawrence Pressman ) , runs off with his secretary . Judy finds employment as a secretary at Consolidated Companies . The senior office supervisor , Violet Newstead ( Lily Tomlin ) , introduces Judy to the company and staff , including mail room clerk Eddie , alcoholic Margaret Foster , the opportunistic boss Franklin Hart , Jr . ( Dabney Coleman ) , and Roz Keith ( Elizabeth Wilson ) , Hart 's executive assistant . Violet reveals to Judy that Hart is supposedly involved with his buxom secretary , Doralee Rhodes ( Dolly Parton ) . Hart exploits and mistreats his female subordinates , with backstabbing and sexist remarks . He takes credit for Violet 's ideas , cruelly yells at and threatens to fire Judy on her first day after an equipment malfunction and sexually harasses Doralee , spreading rumors about an affair that never happened . </P> <P> When Violet discovers that a promotion she was hoping to receive was instead given to a man because of sexist hiring practices , she confronts Hart about it , as well as the rumors about Doralee ( who enters Hart 's office just in time to hear , and now realizes why she has become unpopular with the other secretaries ) . Violet storms off , stating that she needs a drink . Doralee takes Hart to task over his transgressions , informing him that she keeps a gun in her purse and will `` turn him from a rooster to a hen with one shot '' if his sexist behavior continues . She then also leaves , stating that she needs a drink . </P> <P> Judy , upset over the firing of Maria , a dedicated employee ( due to speculating about upper management 's salaries , overheard by Roz , who had been eavesdropping in the ladies ' room ) , joins Violet and Doralee in storming out of the office , and the three women drown their sorrows at the local bar before retiring to Doralee 's house to smoke a joint given to Violet by her teenage son . While there , the beginning of their friendship forms , and they share fantasies of getting revenge on Mr. Hart : Judy wants to hunt him down like an animal in a classic mobster scenario , Doralee wants to rope him like a steer in a Western scenario , and Violet wants to poison him in a twisted Snow White - style scenario . </P> <P> The following day , a mix - up leads Violet to accidentally spike Hart 's coffee with rat poison . However , before he can drink the tainted coffee , Hart falls out of his desk chair and hits his head on the credenza desk , which knocks him out cold . On hearing he has been rushed to the hospital , Violet , thinking he is sick from the accidental poisoning , rushes to the hospital with Judy and Doralee in tow . At the hospital , Hart , who has regained consciousness , leaves on his own without being seen , and the three mistake a dead police witness for their boss , steal the dead body ( to prevent an autopsy ) , stash it in the trunk , and drive off . Soon they discover they 've stolen the wrong body , so they smuggle it back into the hospital . </P> <P> Hart turns up alive the next morning , much to the shock of Violet , Doralee , and Judy . During a break in the ladies ' room , the three speculate on what could have happened , but ultimately decide to consider themselves lucky and simply forget the whole matter . However , Roz , hiding in one of the stalls , overhears them and relates the conversation to Hart . He confronts Doralee about the hospital incident and demands that she spend the night at his house , or he 'll have all three of them prosecuted for attempted murder . </P> <P> The three kidnap him and bring him to his Tudor - style mansion , keeping him prisoner in his bedroom while they find a way to blackmail him . The three women discover an embezzlement scheme and must keep Hart tied up at home while they collect evidence on it . </P> <P> The women use Hart 's absence to effect numerous changes around the office , in his name , including flexible work hours , equal pay for male and female employees , a job - sharing program , and even an onsite daycare center for employees with children . Hart is so disliked around the office by male and female employees alike that the only person to question his absence is Roz , whom Violet sends away to France for a multi-week language training seminar . </P> <P> Meanwhile , as Judy is guarding Hart , her ex-husband , Dick , comes to ask her to take him back . She refuses , forcefully throwing him out . Hart 's adoring wife Missy ( Marian Mercer ) returns from vacation early , putting the women 's plan in jeopardy . Hart manages to break free and return the stolen items back to the warehouse . Then he escorts the women to the office at gunpoint . Hart is appalled by the changes which have been made in his absence , but receives an unexpected visit from Russell Tinsworthy ( Sterling Hayden ) , the company chairman , who has come to congratulate Hart for increases in productivity and numerous other initiatives ( however , he wants the equal pay eliminated ) . Margaret Foster is no longer an alcoholic thanks to the company 's alcohol rehab program , and Maria is back with the company on a part - time basis and sharing her workload with another employee . Tinsworthy is so impressed that he recruits Hart to work at Consolidated 's Brazilian operation for the next few years . Roz returns from her training and is stunned to discover Violet , Judy , and Doralee celebrating in Hart 's office . </P> <P> In the epilogue , it is revealed that Violet finally got promoted to Hart 's job ; Judy falls in love with and marries a Xerox representative ; Doralee quits Consolidated and becomes a country and western singer ; and Hart is abducted by Amazons in the Brazilian jungle and is never heard from again . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Jane Fonda as Judy Bernly , the new woman who is forced to find work after her husband has an affair with his secretary , a younger woman named Liza .

A musician , he is often performing at various gigs , thus allowing Doralee a good deal of free time to get into mischief with Judy and Violet . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film was based on an idea by Jane Fonda , who had recently formed her own production company , IPC . Fonda : </P> <P> My ideas for films always come from things that I hear and perceive in my daily life ... A very old friend of mine had started an organization in Boston called `` Nine To Five '' , which was an association of women office workers . I heard them talking about their work and they had some great stories . And I 've always been attracted to those 1940s films with three female stars . </P> <P> Fonda says the film was at first going to be a drama , but `` any way we did it , it seemed too preachy , too much of a feminist line . I 'd wanted to work with Lily ( Tomlin ) for some time , and it suddenly occurred to ( her producing partner ) Bruce and me that we should make it a comedy . '' Patricia Resnick wrote the first draft drama , and Fonda cast herself , Lily Tomlin , and Dolly Parton in the leads , the latter in her first film role . Then Colin Higgins came on board to direct and rewrite the script . Part of his job was to make room for all three in the script . Higgins says Jane Fonda was a very encouraging producer , who allowed him to push back production while the script was being rewritten . </P> <P> `` He 's a very nice , quiet , low - key guy '' , said Parton of Higgins . `` I do n't know what I would have done if I 'd had one of those mean directors on my first film . '' </P> <P> Higgins admitted `` he expected some tension '' , from working with three stars , `` but they were totally professional , great fun and a joy to work with . I just wish everything would be as easy . '' </P> <P> `` It remains a ' labour film ' , but I hope of a new kind , different from the Grapes of Wrath or Salt of the Earth '' , says Fonda . `` We took out a lot of stuff that was filmed , even stuff the director , Colin Higgins , thought worked but which I asked to have taken out . I 'm just super-sensitive to anything that smacks of the soapbox or lecturing the audience '' . </P> <P> Fonda says she did a deal of research , focusing on women who had begun work late in life due to divorce or being widowed . </P> <P> What I found was that secretaries know the work they do is important , is skilled , but they also know they 're not treated with respect . They call themselves `` office wives '' . They have to put gas in the boss 's car , get his coffee , buy the presents for his wife and mistress . So when we came to do the film , we said to Colin ( Higgins ) , OK , what you have to do is write a screenplay which shows you can run an office without a boss , but you ca n't run an office without the secretaries ! </P> <H2> Filming locations ( edit ) </H2> <P> The home of Franklin Hart is located at 10431 Bellagio Road in Bel Air , Los Angeles . According to commentary included in the DVD release of the film , the home was , at the time , owned by the Chandler family , publishers of the Los Angeles Times . The Consolidated offices were presumably in the Pacific Financial Center located at 800 W 6th Street , at South Flower Street in Los Angeles . Although the story appears to be set in Los Angeles , the opening credit montage , set to the title song , is mostly composed of shots from downtown San Francisco . These shots include an electric MUNI bus , the Market Street clock and a brief glimpse of the San Francisco twins , Marian and Vivian Brown . </P> <H2> Theme song ( edit ) </H2> Main article : 9 to 5 ( Dolly Parton song ) <P> The film 's theme song , `` 9 to 5 '' , written and recorded by Parton , became one of her biggest hits of the decade . While filming the 9 to 5 , Parton found she could use her long acrylic fingernails to simulate the sound of a typewriter . She wrote the song on set by clicking her nails together and forming the beat . The song went to number one for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 , as well as the U.S. country singles charts , and was nominated for several awards , including the Academy Award for Best Song . It won the 1981 People 's Choice Award for `` Favorite Motion Picture Song '' , and two 1982 Grammy Awards : for `` Country Song of the Year '' and `` Female Country Vocal of the Year '' ( it was nominated for four Grammys ) . Additionally , it was certified platinum by the RIAA . </P> <P> At the same time , newcomer Sheena Easton was enjoying her first major hit in the UK with a song also titled `` 9 to 5 '' . With the success of Parton 's song , and to avoid confusion , Easton 's record company renamed her recording `` Morning Train ( 9 to 5 ) '' for its North American release . </P> <H2> Television series ( edit ) </H2> Main article : 9 to 5 ( TV series ) <P> The film inspired a sitcom version which aired from 1982 to 1983 and from 1986 to 1988 . The show , which aired on ABC ( 1982 -- 83 ) and in first run syndication ( 1986 -- 88 ) , featured Parton 's younger sister , Rachel Dennison , in Parton 's role , and Rita Moreno and Valerie Curtin took over Tomlin and Fonda 's roles , respectively . In the second version of the show , Sally Struthers replaced Moreno . A total of 85 episodes were filmed . </P> <H2> 2009 Broadway musical ( edit ) </H2> Main article : 9 to 5 ( musical ) <P> In an interview aired September 30 , 2005 on Larry King Live , Parton revealed that she was writing the songs for a musical stage adaptation of the film . A private reading of the musical took place on January 19 , 2007 . Further private presentations were held in New York City in summer 2007 . </P> <P> In early March 2008 , Center Theatre Group artistic director Michael Ritchie announced that 9 to 5 would have its pre-Broadway run at the Center 's Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles beginning September 21 , 2008 , with Allison Janney starring as Violet , joined by Stephanie J. Block as Judy , Megan Hilty as Doralee , and Marc Kudisch as Franklin Hart , Jr . The book for 9 to 5 : The Musical was written by Patricia Resnick , who co-authored the film . Andy Blankenbuehler choreographed the show , and Joe Mantello directed . </P> <P> According to playbill.com , the musical opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in previews on April 7 , 2009 , and officially on April 30 , 2009 . However , due to low ticket sales and gross , the production closed on September 6 , 2009 . A national tour began in September 2010 . </P> <H2> Possible sequel ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the 1980s , Universal developed a sequel with Colin Higgins . Tom Mankiewicz worked on it for a while and says that while Dolly Parton was enthusiastic , Jane Fonda was not and Higgins ' heart was not in it . </P> <P> In a TV interview broadcast on BBC1 in the UK in 2005 , the movie 's stars Fonda , Tomlin , and Dolly Parton all expressed interest in starring in a sequel . Fonda said if the right script was written she would definitely do it , suggesting a suitable name for a 21st - century sequel would be 24 / 7 . Parton suggested they had better hurry up before they reach retirement age . In the DVD commentary , the three reiterate their enthusiasm ; Fonda suggests a sequel should cover outsourcing and they agree Hart would have to return as their nemesis . </P> <P> In a 2018 interview , Dolly Parton announced that a sequel is in the works to bring the story into a modern - day setting . In July 2018 , Jane Fonda also confirmed that a sequel was in the works with herself , Tomlin and Parton returning to their roles as mentors to a new generation of women . Fonda revealed that she is also an executive producer on the project , while Rashida Jones and Pat Rosnick have been attached to write a script . Fonda reiterated news about the development of a sequel on the October 23 , 2018 edition of GMA Day . </P> <H2> Accolades ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists : </P> <Ul> <Li> 2000 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs -- No. 74 </Li> <Li> 2004 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Songs : <Ul> <Li> `` Nine to Five '' -- No. 78 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2006 : AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers -- Nominated </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Horrible Bosses , a 2011 comedy film </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Aubrey Solomon , Twentieth Century Fox : A Corporate and Financial History , Scarecrow Press , 1989 p259 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` 9 to 5 at boxofficemojo.com '' .

He is widely considered one of the greatest players in NBA history . At 7 ft 1 in ( 2.16 m ) tall and 325 pounds ( 147 kg ) , he was one of the heaviest players ever to play in the NBA , where he played for six teams throughout his 19 - year career . </P> <P> Following his time at Louisiana State University , O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft . He quickly became one of the best centers in the league , winning Rookie of the Year in 1992 -- 93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals . After four years with the Magic , O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers . They won three consecutive championships in 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 . Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant , O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004 , and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006 . Midway through the 2007 -- 2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns . After a season - and - a-half with the Suns , O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009 -- 10 season . O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010 -- 11 season before retiring . </P> <P> O'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999 -- 2000 MVP award , the 1992 -- 93 NBA Rookie of the Year award , 15 All - Star game selections , three All - Star Game MVP awards , three Finals MVP awards , two scoring titles , 14 All - NBA team selections , and three NBA All - Defensive Team selections . He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP , All - Star game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year ( 2000 ) ; the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998 . He ranks 8th all - time in points scored , 6th in field goals , 14th in rebounds , and 8th in blocks . Largely due to his ability to dunk the basketball , O'Neal also ranks third all - time in field goal percentage ( 58.2 % ) . O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016 . He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017 . </P> <P> In addition to his basketball career , O'Neal has released four rap albums , with his first , Shaq Diesel , going platinum . He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows , Shaq 's Big Challenge and Shaq Vs ...

Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant . Upon his release , he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's stepfather , Phillip A. Harrison , a career Army sergeant . O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades ; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship . On his 1994 rap album , Shaq Fu : The Return , O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song `` Biological Did n't Bother '' , dismissing him with the line `` Phil is my father . '' However , O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison 's death in 2013 , and the two met for the first time in March 2016 , with O'Neal telling him , `` I do n't hate you . I had a good life . I had Phil . '' </P> <P> O'Neal credits the Boys and Girls Club of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets . `` It gave me something to do , '' he said . `` I 'd just go there to shoot . I did n't even play on a team . '' Because of his stepfather 's career in the military , the family left Newark , moving to military bases in Germany and Texas . </P> <P> At Robert G. Cole High School in San Antonio , Texas , O'Neal led his team to a 68 -- 1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year . His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification . O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul - Jabbar , 33 . However , his high school team did not have a 33 jersey , so O'Neal chose to wear 32 before college . </P> <P> On January 31 , 2012 , O'Neal was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald 's All - Americans . </P> <H2> College career </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section is missing information about when subject went to LSU . Please expand the section to include this information . Further details may exist on the talk page . ( November 2017 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> After graduating from high school , O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University . He had first met Dale Brown , LSU 's men 's basketball coach , years earlier in Europe . O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken , West Germany . While playing for Brown at LSU , O'Neal was a two - time All - American , two - time SEC Player of the Year , and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men 's basketball player of the year in 1991 ; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI . O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career , but continued his education even after becoming a professional player . He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame . A 900 - pound bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Tigers Basketball Practice Facility . </P> <H2> NBA career </H2> <H3> Orlando Magic ( 1992 -- 1996 ) </H3> <P> The Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft . During that summer , prior to moving to Orlando , he spent a significant amount of time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson . Given Terry Catledge eventually refused to give O'Neal the 33 jersey , he relented by going back to the 32 from his high school days . O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA , becoming the first player to do so . During his rookie season , O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2 % shooting , 13.9 rebounds , and 3.5 blocks per game for the season . He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and became the first rookie to be voted an All - Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985 . The Magic finished 41 -- 41 , winning 20 more games than the previous season ; however , the team ultimately missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie - breaker with the Indiana Pacers . On more than one occasion during the year , Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying , `` We 've got to get ( head coach ) Matty ( Guokas ) out of here and bring in ( assistant ) Brian ( Hill ) . '' </P> <P> In 1993 -- 1994 , O'Neal's second season , Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office . O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points ( second in the league to David Robinson ) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60 % . On November 20 , 1993 , against the New Jersey Nets , O'Neal registered the first triple - double of his career , recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks . He was voted into the All - Star game and also made the All - NBA 3rd Team . Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee `` Penny '' Hardaway , the Magic finished with a record of 50 -- 32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history . In his first playoff series , O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds in a losing effort as the Magic lost every game to the Indiana Pacers . </P> <P> O'Neal's third season in 1994 -- 95 had him leading the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average , while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All - Star Game along with Hardaway . They formed one of the league 's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57 -- 25 record and the Atlantic Division crown . The Magic won their first ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs . They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals . After beating Reggie Miller 's Indiana Pacers , the Magic reached the NBA Finals , facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets . O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance , averaging 28 points on 59.5 % shooting , 12.5 rebounds , and 6.3 assists . Despite this , the Rockets , led by future Hall - of - Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler , swept the series in four games . </P> <P> O'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995 -- 96 season , missing 28 games . He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game , made the All - NBA 3rd Team , and played in his 4th All - Star Game . Despite O'Neal's injuries , the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60 -- 22 , second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls , who finished with an NBA record 72 wins . Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs ; however , they were no match for Jordan 's Bulls , who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals . </P> <H3> Los Angeles Lakers ( 1996 -- 2004 ) </H3> In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers ( 1996 -- 2004 ) , O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals . <P> O'Neal became a free agent after the 1995 -- 96 NBA season . </P> <P> In the summer of 1996 , O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team , and was later part of the gold medal - winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta . While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando , the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning . 82 % answered `` no '' . O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill . He said the team `` just did n't respect ( Hill ) . '' Another question in the poll asked , `` Is Shaq worth $115 million ? '' in reference to the amount of the Magic 's offer . 91.3 % of the response was `` no '' . O'Neal's Olympic teammates rode him hard over the poll . He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry . O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to `` feeling like a big fish in a dried - up pond . '' O'Neal also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him . </P> <P> On the team 's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta , it was announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven - year , $121 million contract . He insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money . `` I 'm tired of hearing about money , money , money , money , money '' , O'Neal said after the signing . `` I just want to play the game , drink Pepsi , wear Reebok '' , he added , referring to a couple of his product endorsements . The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996 -- 97 season . O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles ; however , he again missed over 30 games due to injury . The Lakers made the playoffs , but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games . In his first playoff game for the Lakers , O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers , the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969 . On December 17 , 1996 , O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls ; Rodman 's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict . The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman , and O'Neal said : `` It 's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough . '' </P> <P> The following season , O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds . He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage , the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so . The Lakers finished the season 61 -- 21 , first in the Pacific Division , and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs . After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds , the Lakers again fell to the Jazz , this time in a 4 -- 0 sweep . </P> <P> With the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant , expectations for the Lakers increased . However , personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998 -- 99 season . Long - time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets ; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back - up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter . Coach Del Harris was fired , and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach . The Lakers finished with a 31 -- 19 record during the lockout - shortened season . Although they made the playoffs , they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs , led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs . The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999 . </P> Championship seasons <P> In 1999 , prior to the 1999 -- 2000 season , the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach , and the team 's fortunes soon changed . Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal , telling him `` the ( NBA 's ) MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired . '' Using Jackson 's triangle offense , O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success , leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles ( 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 ) . O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history . In the November 10 , 1999 , game against the Houston Rockets , O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected . After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley , O'Neal shoved Barkley , who then threw the ball at O'Neal . </P> <P> O'Neal was also voted the 1999 -- 2000 regular season Most Valuable Player , one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history . Fred Hickman , then of CNN , instead chose Allen Iverson , then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season . O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots . Jackson 's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense , resulting in his first All - Defensive Team selection ( second - team ) in 2000 . </P> <P> In the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers , O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo , the 2000 -- 2001 Defensive Player of the Year . `` I did n't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that . It 's a shame that the referees buy into that '' , O'Neal said . `` I wish he 'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down . </P> <P> A month before the 2001 -- 02 season 's training camp , O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot . He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker . He was ready for the start of the 2001 -- 02 regular season , but the toe frequently bothered him . In January 2002 , he was involved in a spectacular on - court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls . He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket , resulting in a melee with Miller , forward Charles Oakley , and several other players . O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000 . For the season , O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds , excellent statistics but below his career average ; he was less of a defensive force during the season . </P> O'Neal at the White House greeting US President George W. Bush with his fellow Lakers <P> Matched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals , O'Neal said , `` There is only one way to beat us . It starts with c and ends with t . '' O'Neal meant `` cheat '' in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings ' center Vlade Divac . O'Neal referred to Divac as `` she '' , and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul . `` I 'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work . '' After the 2001 -- 2002 season , O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe . His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent . The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication . O'Neal was already wary of the long - term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have . He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk . </P> Toe surgery to departure <P> O'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002 -- 2003 season recovering from toe surgery . He was sidelined with hallux rigidus , a degenerative arthritis in his toe . He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained , `` I got hurt on company time , so I 'll heal on company time . '' O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months , but he opted against the more involved procedure . The Lakers started the season with a record of 11 -- 19 . At the end of the season , the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003 . </P> <P> For the 2003 - 04 season , the team made a concerted off - season effort to improve its roster . They sought the free - agent services of forward Karl Malone and aging guard Gary Payton , but due to salary cap restrictions , could not offer either one nearly as much money as they could have made with some other teams . O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad . Ultimately , both signed , each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship , which neither had accomplished in his career ( and which neither would achieve with the Lakers ) . At the beginning of the 2003 -- 04 season , O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million . The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age , physical conditioning , and games missed due to injuries . During a preseason game , O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss , `` Pay me . '' There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant . The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003 -- 2004 season when Bryant , in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray , criticized O'Neal for being out of shape , a poor leader , and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the Lakers . </P> <P> The Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals . Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said , `` Shaq defeated himself against Detroit . He played way too passively . He had one big game ... He 's always interested in being a scorer , but he has n't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding . '' After the series , O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club , as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss . O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team 's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns , and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade . Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks ' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7 - footer go . However , Miami showed interest , and eventually the two clubs agreed . Winter said , `` ( O'Neal ) left because he could n't get what he wanted -- a huge pay raise . There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted . Shaq 's demands held the franchise hostage , and the way he went about it did n't please the owner too much . '' </P> <H3> Miami Heat ( 2004 -- 2008 ) </H3> O'Neal with Miami in 2007 <P> On July 14 , 2004 , O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler , Lamar Odom , Brian Grant , and a future first - round draft choice ( who would turn into Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft ) . O'Neal reverted from ( his Lakers jersey ) number 34 to number 32 , which he had worn while playing for the Magic . Upon signing with the Heat , O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami . He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up - and - coming star Dwyane Wade , to whom he gave the nickname `` Flash '' . With O'Neal on board , the new - look Heat surpassed expectations , claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004 -- 05 with 59 wins . He played in 73 games , his most since 2001 season , averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks . Shaq also made his 12th consecutive All - Star Team , made the All - NBA 1st Team , and won the Eastern Conference player of the Month award for his performance in March . O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004 -- 05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history . </P> <P> Despite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise , O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons , losing by a narrow margin . Afterwards , O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal . In August 2005 , O'Neal signed a 5 - year - extension with the Heat for $100 million . Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat 's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term . They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year , particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount . </P> <P> In the second game of the 2005 -- 06 season , O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games . Upon O'Neal's return , Van Gundy resigned , citing family reasons , and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities . O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a `` frontrunner '' and a `` master of panic . '' Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season , limiting his minutes to a career low . Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time . Although O'Neal averaged career lows ( or near - lows ) in points , rebounds , and blocks , he said in an interview `` Stats do n't matter . I care about winning , not stats . If I score 0 points and we win I 'm happy . If I score 50 , 60 points , break the records , and we lose , I 'm pissed off . ' Cause I knew I did something wrong . I 'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game . '' During the 2005 -- 06 season , the Heat recorded only a . 500 record without O'Neal in the line - up . </P> <P> On April 11 , 2006 , O'Neal recorded his second career triple - double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points , 11 rebounds and a career high 10 assists . O'Neal finished the 2005 -- 06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage . </P> Fourth championship O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House <P> In the 2006 NBA Playoffs , the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls , and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point , 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22 - point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2 - 0 lead in the series . Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series , but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5 . Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game , highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds . Miami advanced to face New Jersey , who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit . The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series , while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3 - 2 series lead . The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit , and Wade would once again get injured , but the Heat held on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first ever NBA Finals . </P> <P> In the Finals , the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki , and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion . The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal , Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home , before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title . With Wade carrying the offensive load , O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series , and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series . </P> Surgery and Wade 's injury <P> In the 2006 -- 07 season , O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery . After one of those missed games , a Christmas Day match - up against the Lakers , he ripped Jackson , who O'Neal had once called a second father , referring to his former coach as `` Benedict Arnold '' . Jackson had previously said , `` The only person I 've ever ( coached ) that has n't been a worker ... is probably Shaq . '' The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence , but with his return won seven of their next eight games . Bad luck still haunted the squad , however , as Wade dislocated his left shoulder , leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team . Critics doubted that O'Neal , now in his mid-thirties , could carry the team into the playoffs . The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot , which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5 . </P> <P> In a rematch of the year before , the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006 -- 07 NBA playoffs . The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers , he was not able to dominate the series . The Bulls swept the Heat , the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round . It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round . In the 2006 -- 07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points , becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone . However , it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game . </P> 2007 -- 2008 season <P> O'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007 -- 08 season , averaging career lows in points , rebounds , and blocks . His role in the offense diminished , as he attempted only 10 field goals per game , versus his career average of 17 . In addition , O'Neal was plagued by fouls , and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games . O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All - Star appearances ended that season . O'Neal again missed games due to injuries , and the Heat had a 15 -- game losing streak . According to O'Neal , Riley thought he was faking the injury . During a practice in February 2008 , O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice . The two argued face - to - face , with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away . Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal . O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not `` all that good '' by the time he left Miami , but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him . </P> <P> O'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007 -- 08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns . O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game . Following the trade to Phoenix , O'Neal averaged 12.9 ppg while starting all 28 games with the Suns . </P> <H3> Phoenix Suns ( 2008 -- 2009 ) </H3> <P> The Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league - worst Miami Heat , who had a record at the time of the trade of 9 - 37 , in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks . O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20 , 2008 , against his former Lakers team , scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process . The Lakers won , 130 -- 124 . O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference , stating : `` I will take the blame for this loss because I was n't in tune with the guys ( ... ) But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I 'll get it . '' </P> <P> In 28 regular - season games , O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds , good enough to make the playoffs . One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs , especially after the Suns ' six - game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs . O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs , but they were once again eliminated , in five games . O'Neal averaged 15.2 points , 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game . </P> <P> O'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat . `` I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys '' , O'Neal said . `` We have professionals who know what to do . No one is asking me to play with ( his former Heat teammates ) Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis . I 'm actually on a team again . '' Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates . O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley , whom he often referred to as the `` great Pat Riley '' while playing for the Heat . O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career . They connected his arthritic toe , which would not bend , to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg . The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength , flexibility , and balance . </P> <P> The 2008 -- 09 season improved for O'Neal , who averaged 18 pts , 9 rebounds , and 1.6 blocks through the first half ( 41 games ) of the season , leading the Suns to a 23 -- 18 record and 2nd place in their division . He returned to the All - Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant . </P> O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash . <P> On February 27 , 2009 , O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds , his 49th career 40 - point game , beating the Toronto Raptors 133 -- 113 . </P> <P> In a matchup against Orlando on March 3 , 2009 , O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard , 21 -- 19 . `` I 'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18 - year - olds '' , O'Neal said , referring to the then 23 - year - old Howard . `` It 's not really my role anymore . '' O'Neal was double - teamed most of the night . `` I like to play people one - on - one . My whole career I had to play people one - on - one . Never once had to double or ask for a double . But it 's cool '' , said O'Neal . During the game , O'Neal flopped against Howard . Magic coach Stan Van Gundy , who had coached O'Neal with the Heat , was `` very disappointed cause ( O'Neal ) knows what it 's like . Let 's stand up and play like men , and I think our guy did that tonight . '' O'Neal responded , `` Flopping is playing like that your whole career . I was trying to take the charge , trying to get a call . It probably was a flop , but flopping is the wrong use of words . Flopping would describe his coaching . '' Mark Madsen , a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years , found it amusing since `` everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back . '' In a 2006 interview in TIME , O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner , he would `` Make a guy have to beat a guy -- not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass . '' </P> <P> On March 6 , O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming . `` It 's not going to be man - on - man , so do n't even try that , '' says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh . `` They 're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play ( Yao ) one - on - one ... But when I play him ( on defense ) , it 's just going to be me down there . So do n't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing , when it 's Shaq versus four other guys . '' </P> <P> The 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992 -- 93 that he did not participate in the playoffs . He was named as a member of the All - NBA Third Team . The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs . </P> <H3> Cleveland Cavaliers ( 2009 -- 2010 ) </H3> <P> On June 25 , 2009 , O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic , Ben Wallace , $500,000 , and a 2010 - second round draft pick . Upon arriving in Cleveland , O'Neal said , `` My motto is very simple : Win a Ring for the King '' , referring to LeBron James . James was the leader of the team , and O'Neal deferred to him . On February 25 , 2010 , O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics . He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs . After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round , the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round . In September 2016 , O'Neal said : `` When I was in Cleveland , we were in first place . Big Baby ( Glen Davis ) breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year . I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs , and we lost to Boston in the second round . I was upset . I know for a fact if I was healthy , we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring . '' O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009 -- 10 season , taking on a much less significant role than in previous years . </P> <H3> Boston Celtics ( 2010 -- 2011 ) </H3> O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics <P> Upon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal , Wyc Grousbeck , principal owner of the Celtics , saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal . Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami . On August 4 , 2010 , the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal . The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million . O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract , but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal . The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands . He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10 , 2010 , and chose the number 36 . </P> <P> O'Neal said he did n't `` compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball , throwing up 30 shots a night -- like D -- Wade , Kobe . '' O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan : `` If Tim Duncan gets five rings , then that gives some writer the chance to say ' Duncan is the best , ' and I ca n't have that . '' Publicly , he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics , but expected to be part of the second unit . Privately , he wanted to start , but kept it to himself . O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg including knee , calf , hip , and Achilles injuries . The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins ' role . The Celtics were 33 -- 10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury , and they were 19 -- 3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes . After requesting a cortisone shot , O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles ; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf . It was the last regular season game he would play that year . O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs . He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round , but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs . </P> <P> On June 1 , 2011 , O'Neal announced his retirement via social media . On a short tape on Twitter , O'Neal tweeted , `` We did it . Nineteen years , baby . I want to thank you very much . That 's why I 'm telling you first . I 'm about to retire . Love you . Talk to you soon . '' On June 3 , 2011 , O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement . </P> <H2> National team career </H2> <P> While in college , O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot , but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner . His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament . While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8 -- 0 record , O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double - doubles . In four games , he scored more than 20 points . Before 2010 , he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup . </P> <P> He was one of two players ( the other being Reggie Miller ) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III . Due to more star - power , he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games . He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks . Again , a perfect 8 -- 0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta . O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game ; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson 's last Olympics . </P> <P> After his 1996 experience , he declined to play in international competition . He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad , saying it was a `` lack of respect '' . He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics , explaining that two gold medals were enough . Shaq also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship . He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics , and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006 -- 2008 US preliminary roster , he eventually declined the invitation . </P> <H2> Player profile </H2> O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses . <P> O'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence , putting up career averages of 23.7 points on . 582 field goal accuracy , 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game . </P> <P> At 7 ft 1 in ( 2.16 m ) , 325 lb ( 147 kg ; 23.2 st ) and U.S. shoe size 23 , he became famous for his physical stature . His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents . On two occasions during his first season in the NBA his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports , prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993 -- 94 season . </P> <P> O'Neal's `` drop step '' , ( called the `` Black Tornado '' by O'Neal ) in which he posted up a defender , turned around and , using his elbows for leverage , powered past him for a very high - percentage slam dunk , proved an effective offensive weapon . In addition , O'Neal frequently used a right - handed jump hook shot to score near the basket . The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of . 582 , second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time . He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times , breaking Wilt Chamberlain 's record of nine . </P> <P> Opposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal , reducing the playing time of their own big men . O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams ' offensive and defensive strategies . </P> <P> O'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting , with a career average of 52.7 % . He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8 , 2000 , a record . O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue , as he often shot 80 percent in practice . In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting , opponents often committed intentional fouls against him , a tactic known as `` Hack - a-Shaq '' . O'Neal was the third - ranked player all - time in free throws taken , having attempted 11,252 free - throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010 -- 11 season . On December 25 , 2008 , O'Neal missed his 5,000 th free throw , becoming the second player in NBA history to do so , along with Chamberlain . </P> <P> O'Neal only made one three point shot during his entire career . He made the shot during the 1995 -- 96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic . His career three point shot record is 1 for 22 ( a 4.5 % career percentage ) . </P> <P> O'Neal was a capable defender , named three times to the All - NBA Second Defensive Team . His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket , and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career . </P> <P> Phil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career , saying he `` could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons . '' The Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2 , 2013 . </P> <P> On February 26 , 2016 , the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016 -- 17 season , making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams . The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22 , 2016 , during halftime of a game against his former team , the Los Angeles Lakers . </P> <H2> Media personality </H2> <P> O'Neal called himself `` The Big Aristotle '' and `` Hobo Master '' for his composure and insights during interviews . Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames including `` ' Shaq ' '' , `` The Diesel '' , `` Shaq Fu '' , `` The Big Daddy '' , `` Superman '' , `` The Big Agave '' , `` The Big Cactus '' , `` The Big Shaqtus '' , `` The Big Galactus '' , `` Wilt Chamberneezy '' , `` The Big Baryshnikov '' , `` The Real Deal '' , `` The Big Shamrock '' , `` The Big Leprechaun '' , `` Shaqovic '' , and `` The Big Conductor '' . Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press , O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking . When he did not want to speak with the press , he employed an interview technique whereby , sitting in front of his cubicle , he would murmur in his low - pitched voice . </P> <P> During the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike , O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney . O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line . </P> <P> O'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers ' long - standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings ; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the `` Queens . '' During the 2002 victory parade , O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California , after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal . </P> <P> He also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming . O'Neal told a reporter , `` you tell Yao Ming , ching chong yang , wah , ah so . '' O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense . Yao believed that O'Neal was joking , but he said a lot of Asians would n't see the humor . Yao joked , `` Chinese is hard to learn . I had trouble with it when I was little . '' O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career . </P> <P> During the 2005 NBA playoffs , O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier , a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games . The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs , though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult . The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals . </P> <P> O'Neal was very vocal with the media , often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant . In the summer of 2005 , when asked about Bryant , he responded , `` I 'm sorry , who ?

They will play six or seven games against each of the other ten same - league opponents for a total of 66 games , and 20 inter-league games . The primary inter-league match - ups are AL East vs. NL Central , AL Central vs. NL West , and AL West vs. NL East . Teams will also play four games against a designated interleague rival . </P> <P> On March 9 , it was announced that the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals would play a game at the minor league BB&T Ballpark in Williamsport , Pennsylvania on August 20 . The game coincided with the Little League World Series , held annually in nearby South Williamsport . The game was exclusively attended by Little League players and their families ; no public tickets were available for the game . </P> <H3> Effect of hurricanes Harvey and Irma ( edit ) </H3> <P> As a consequence of Hurricane Harvey damaging the Houston area , the three - game Lone Star Series between the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros from August 29 -- 31 was moved from Minute Maid Park to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg , Florida . Although the Astros were the designated home team , they wore their away uniforms during the series while the Rangers wore their home uniforms . The Astros returned to Minute Maid Park for a three - game series with the New York Mets , beginning with a split doubleheader on September 2 . </P> <P> The Tampa Bay Rays ' three - game set with the New York Yankees from September 11 -- 13 was moved from Tropicana Field to Queens ' Citi Field due to Hurricane Irma 's impending landfall on the Tampa Bay Area . </P> <P> Irma 's damage to South Florida also forced the Miami Marlins ' three - game set with the Milwaukee Brewers from September 15 -- 17 to move from Marlins Park to the Brewers ' home field at Miller Park , with the Marlins as the designated home team . Similar to the Rangers -- Astros series in Tampa Bay , the Marlins wore their away uniforms as the ' home ' team , while the Brewers wore their home uniforms as the ' away ' team . </P> <H2> Standings

start of a no - pitch intentional walk , allowing the defensive team 's manager to signal a decision to the home plate umpire to intentionally walk the batter . Following the signal of the manager 's intention , the umpire will immediately award first base to the batter . </Li> <Li> A 30 - second limit for a manager to decide whether to challenge a play and invoke replay review . </Li> <Li> When a manager has exhausted his challenges for the game , Crew Chiefs may now invoke replay review for non-home run calls beginning in the eighth inning instead of the seventh inning . </Li> <Li> A conditional two - minute guideline for Replay Officials to render a decision on replay review , allowing various exceptions . </Li> <Li> A prohibition on the use of any markers on the field that could create a tangible reference system for fielders . </Li> <Li> An addition to Rule 5.07 formalizes an umpire interpretation by stipulating that a pitcher may not take a second step toward home plate with either foot or otherwise reset his pivot foot in his delivery of the pitch . If there is at least one runner on base , then such an action will be called as a balk under Rule 6.02 ( a ) . If the bases are unoccupied , then it will be considered an illegal pitch under Rule 6.02 ( b ) . </Li> <Li> An amendment to Rule 5.03 requires base coaches to position themselves behind the line of the coach 's box closest to home plate and the front line that runs parallel to the foul line prior to each pitch . Once a ball is put in play , a base coach is allowed to leave the coach 's box to signal a player so long as the coach does not interfere with the play . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Managerial changes ( edit ) </H2> <H3> General managers ( edit ) </H3> Offseason ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Team </Th> <Th> Former GM </Th> <Th> Reason For Leaving </Th> <Th> New GM </Th> <Th> Story / Accomplishments </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Arizona Diamondbacks </Td> <Td> Dave Stewart </Td> <Td> Fired </Td> <Td> Mike Hazen </Td> <Td> On October 3 , 2016 , General Manager Dave Stewart was fired , along with field manager Chip Hale .

The new system uses a doppler radar to calculate pitch speed based on maximum velocity ( typically from the release of the pitch ) , rather than the speed measured 55 feet ( 17 m ) from home plate . The change in data source has led to discrepancies in pitch speed reports between those reported in 2016 and 2017 , with some pitches registering slightly higher speeds than with the previous system . </P> <H2> Uniforms ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Wholesale changes ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Arizona Diamondbacks tweaked their uniform set that was unveiled last season .

It will be worn on Sunday home games and select other games in the month of July . They also promoted their white - paneled home caps to alternate status after wearing them once the past two seasons . </P> <P> The Cleveland Indians retired their cream alternate uniforms .

The pattern was the same for all 30 teams . In addition , seven teams unveiled new caps to be worn for Spring Training .

Apart from the Reds and Phillies , which respectively used white and off - white for the main body of the jersey , all teams used colors in that area . </Li> <Li> All jerseys had player names on the back ; players were encouraged ( but not required ) to use nicknames instead of family names ( or , in the case of Ichiro Suzuki , his given name ) . Notably , Players Weekend marked the first time that an official Yankees jersey had a name on the back . </Li> <Li> The jerseys were complemented with special colored caps . Many featured slight modifications of the teams ' current logos , but some used completely new logos . For example , the Phillies ' cap logo for Players Weekend was a blue Liberty Bell . </Li> <Li> The jerseys and caps featured a special logo showing a player 's progression from youth to adulthood . The design drew cues from the official Little League and MLB logos . </Li> <Li> The aforementioned logo also appeared on a special `` Thank You '' sleeve patch on each jersey . This patch included a blank space that allowed each player to write in the name of a key figure in his baseball development . </Li> <Li> All teams used special multi-colored socks , all with the same design . </Li> <Li> Normal color restrictions on accessories such as shoes and batting gloves were relaxed to allow more self - expression . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Throwbacks ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Indians and Royals wore Negro Leagues throwbacks May 7 .

{"document_text": "Cephalopod ink - wikipedia <H1> Cephalopod ink </H1> Ventral view of the viscera of Chtenopteryx sicula , showing the location of the ink sac <P> Cephalopod ink is a dark pigment released into water by most species of cephalopod , usually as an escape mechanism . All cephalopods , with the exception of the Nautilidae and the Cirrina ( deep - sea octopuses ) , are able to release ink . </P> <P> The ink is released from the ink sacs ( located between the gills ) and is dispersed more widely when its release is accompanied by a jet of water from the siphon . Its dark colour is caused by its main constituent , melanin . Each species of cephalopod produces slightly differently coloured inks ; generally , octopuses produce black ink , squid ink is blue - black , and cuttlefish ink is a shade of brown . </P> <P> A number of other aquatic molluscs have similar responses to attack , including the gastropod clade known as sea hares . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Inking behaviours </Li> <Li> 2 Physical properties </Li> <Li> 3 Chemical composition </Li> <Li> 4 Protective mechanisms </Li> <Li> 5 Use by humans </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Inking behaviours ( edit ) </H2> I was much interested , on several occasions , by watching the habits of an Octopus or cuttle - fish ... they darted tail first , with the rapidity of an arrow , from one side of the pool to the other , at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnut - brown ink . <P> Charles Darwin , The Voyage of the Beagle </P> <P> Two distinct behaviours have been observed in inking cephalopods . The first is the release of large amounts of ink into the water by the cephalopod in order to create a dark , diffuse cloud ( much like a smoke screen ) that can obscure the predator 's view , allowing the cephalopod to make a rapid retreat by jetting away . </P> <P> The second response to a predator is to release pseudomorphs ( `` false bodies '' ) , smaller clouds of ink with a greater mucus content , which allows them to hold their shape for longer . These are expelled slightly away from the cephalopod in question , which will often release several pseudomorphs and change colour ( blanch ) in conjunction with these releases . The pseudomorphs are roughly the same volume as and look similar to the cephalopod that released them , and many predators have been observed attacking them mistakenly , allowing the cephalopod to escape ( this behaviour is often referred to as the `` blanch - ink - jet manoeuvre '' ) . </P> <P> Furthermore , green turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) hatchlings that have been observed mistakenly attacking pseudomorphs released by Octopus bocki have subsequently ignored conspecific octopuses . </P> <P> However , many cephalopod predators ( for instance moray eels ) have advanced chemosensory systems , and some anecdotal evidence suggests that compounds ( such as tyrosinase ) found in cephalopod ink can irritate , numb or even deactivate such apparatus . Unfortunately , few controlled experiments have been conducted to substantiate this . Cephalopod ink is nonetheless generally thought to be more sophisticated than a simple `` smoke screen '' ; the ink of a number of squid and cuttlefish has been shown to function as a conspecific chemical alarm . </P> <P> Octopuses have also been observed squirting ink at snails or crabs approaching their eggs . </P> <P> Numerous cuttlefish species add a coat of ink to their eggs , presumably to camouflage them from potential predators . </P> <H2> Physical properties ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion with : examples of other inks besides that of the common cuttlefish , and comparisons between them . You can help by adding to it . ( July 2018 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Sepia officinalis ink forms a polidisperse suspension composed by spheric particles with a size between 80 and 150 nm ( measured by TRPS and SEM ) . The particles have a density of 1.27 g cm , which may be due to the amount of metals that has in its composition ( 4.7 % in weight ) . </P> <H2> Chemical composition ( edit ) </H2> <P> Cephalopod ink contains a number of chemicals in a variety of different concentrations , depending on the species . However , its main constituents are melanin and mucus . It can also contain , among other things , tyrosinase , dopamine and L - DOPA , as well as small amounts of free amino acids , including taurine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid , alanine and lysine . </P> <H2> Protective mechanisms ( edit ) </H2> <P> Cephalopod inking in the sea hare Aplysia californica provides protection from spiny lobsters , a major predator of sea hares , by means of three mechanisms : </P> <Ul> <Li> chemical deterrence , </Li> <Li> sensory disruption , and </Li> <Li> phagomimicry . </Li> </Ul> <P> The typical defence response of the sea hare to a predator is the release of chemicals such as free amino acids , ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland . Chemical deterrence involves the release of toxic chemicals that are noxious to predators and rapidly dissuades them from feeding . Ink creates a dark , diffuse cloud in the water that disrupts the sensory perception of the predator by acting as a smoke screen and as a decoy . The opaline , which affects the senses dealing with feeding , causes the predator to instinctively attack the cloud of chemicals as if it were indeed food . </P> <H2> Use by humans ( edit ) </H2> Arròs negre owes its dark colour to squid ink <P> Cephalopod ink has , as its name suggests , been used in the past as ink ; indeed , the Greek name for cuttlefish , and the taxonomic name of a cuttlefish genus , Sepia , is associated with the brown colour of cuttlefish ink ( for more information , see sepia ) . Modern use of cephalopod ink is generally limited to cooking , where it is used as a food colouring and flavouring , for example in pasta and sauces . For this purpose it is generally obtainable from fishmongers or gourmet food suppliers . The ink is extracted from the ink sacs during preparation of the dead cephalopod , usually squid , and therefore contains no mucus . </P> <P> Recent studies have shown that cephalopod ink is toxic to some cells , including tumor cells . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Roger T.

After planting the trees the land could only be completely obtained if it was occupied by the same family for at least 5 years . The act was passed to prevent abuse of the original Homestead Act in 1862 . Later the amount of land that needed to be set aside for trees was reduced to 10 acres ( 4.0 ha ) . Any potential settler , including foreign immigrants , could claim this land under both this act and the Homestead Act provided the claimant had become a U.S. citizen by the time of proving up . Timber was needed to sell and use for building materials . This timber would provide them with wood for fires and building . It would also act as a wind break reducing the problem of the strong winds on the plains . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ U.S. Statutes at Large , vol. 17 , p. 605 .

The age of majority depends upon jurisdiction and application , but it is generally 18 . Minor may also be used in contexts that are unconnected to the overall age of majority . For example , the drinking age in the United States is usually 21 , and younger people are sometimes called minors in the context of alcohol law , even if they are at least 18 . The term underage often refers to those under the age of majority , but it may also refer to persons under a certain age limit , such as the drinking age , smoking age , age of consent , marriageable age , driving age , voting age , etc . Such age limits are often different from the age of majority . </P> <P> The concept of minor is not sharply defined in most jurisdictions . The ages of criminal responsibility and consent , the age at which school attendance is no longer compulsory , the age at which legally binding contracts can be entered into , and so on may be different from one another . </P> <P> In many countries , including Australia , India , Brazil , Croatia , and Colombia , a minor is defined as a person under the age of 18 . In the United States , where the age of majority is set by the individual states , minor usually refers to someone under the age of 18 but can , in some states , be used in certain areas ( such as casino gambling , handgun ownership and the consuming of alcohol ) to define someone under the age of 21 . In the criminal justice system in some places , `` minor '' is not entirely consistent , as a minor may be tried and punished for a crime either as a `` juvenile '' or , usually only for `` extremely serious crimes '' such as murder , as an `` adult '' . </P> <P> In Japan , Taiwan , and Thailand , a minor is a person under 20 years of age . In New Zealand law , the age of majority is 20 years of age as well , but most of the rights of adulthood are assumed at lower ages : for example , entering contracts and having a will are allowed at 15 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 International <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Canada </Li> <Li> 1.2 Italy </Li> <Li> 1.3 Mexico </Li> <Li> 1.4 India </Li> <Li> 1.5 Thailand </Li> <Li> 1.6 United Kingdom </Li> <Li> 1.7 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Emancipation of minors </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> <Li> 4 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> International ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Canada ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Youth Criminal Justice Act <P> For all provincial laws ( such as alcohol and tobacco regulation ) , the provincial and territorial governments have the power to set the age of majority in their respective province or territory , and the age varies across Canada . </P> <P> Alberta , Manitoba , Ontario , Quebec , Saskatchewan , and Prince Edward Island have the age of majority set at 18 , while in British Columbia , Yukon , Northwest Territories , Nunavut , Newfoundland , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick the age of majority is 19 . In Saskatchewan , the legal gaming age and the legal drinking age are both 19 . </P> <H3> Italy ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Italy , law nr. 39 of March 8 , 1975 , states that a minor is a person under the age of 18 . Citizens under the age of 18 may not vote ( to vote for senators , 25 ) , be elected , obtain a driving license for automobiles or issue or sign legal instruments . Crimes committed in Italy by minors are tried in a juvenile court . </P> <H3> Mexico ( edit ) </H3> <P> In all 31 states , a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18 . </P> <P> Minors aged 16 or 17 who are charged with crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult . </P> <H3> India ( edit ) </H3> <P> In all 29 states and 7 union territories , a minor is referred to as someone under the age of 18 . In rare cases minors aged 16 or 17 who are charged with extremely heinous crimes could sometimes be treated as an adult . </P> <H3> Thailand ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Civil and Commercial Code of the Kingdom of Thailand does not define the term `` minor '' ; however , sections 19 and 20 read as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Section 19 -- A person , on completion of 20 years of age ceases to be a minor and become sui juris </Li> <Li> Section 20 -- A minor becomes sui juris upon marriage , provided that the marriage is made in accordance with the provisions of Section 1448 </Li> </Ul> <P> Hence , a minor in Thailand refers to any person under the age of 20 , unless they are married . A minor is restricted from doing juristic acts -- for example , sign contracts . When a minor wishes to do a juristic act , he has to obtain the consent from his legal representative , usually ( but not always ) the parents and otherwise the act is voidable . The exceptions are acts by which a minor merely acquires a right or is freed from a duty , acts that are strictly personal , and acts that are suitable to the person 's condition in life and are required for their reasonable needs . A minor can make a will at the age of fifteen . </P> <H3> United Kingdom ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Law of England and Wales , Law of Northern Ireland , and Law of Scotland <P> In England and Wales and in Northern Ireland a minor is a person under the age of 18 ; this is also true for Scotland . The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland is 10 ; and 12 in Scotland , formerly 8 , which was the lowest age in Europe . </P> <P> In England and Wales , cases of minors breaking the law are often dealt with by the Youth Offending Team . If they are incarcerated , they are sent to a Young Offender Institution . </P> <P> Things that persons under 18 are prohibited from doing include sitting on a jury , voting , standing as a candidate , buying or renting films with an 18 certificate or R18 certificate or seeing them in a cinema , being depicted in pornographic materials , suing without a litigant friend , being civilly liable , accessing adoption records and purchasing alcohol , tobacco products , knives and fireworks . The rules on minimum age for sale of these products are frequently broken so in practice drinking and smoking takes place before the age of majority ; however many UK shops are tightening restrictions on them by asking for identifying documentation from potentially underage customers . </P> <P> Driving certain large vehicles , acting as personal license holder for licensed premises , and adopting a child are only permitted after the age of 21 . The minimum age to drive a HGV1 vehicle was reduced to 18 . However , certain vehicles , e.g. , steamrollers , require that someone be 21 years of age to obtain an operating license . </P> <H3> United states ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the United States as of 1995 , minor is generally legally defined as a person under the age of 18 . Although in the context of alcohol or gambling laws , people under the age of 21 may also sometimes be referred to as `` minors '' . However , not all minors are considered `` juveniles '' in terms of criminal responsibility . As is frequently the case in the United States , the laws vary widely by state . </P> <P> Under this distinction , those considered juveniles are usually ( but not always ) tried in juvenile court , and they may be afforded other special protections . For example , in some states a parent or guardian must be present during police questioning , or their names may be kept confidential when they are accused of a crime . For many crimes ( especially more violent crimes ) , the age at which a minor may be tried as an adult is variable below the age of 18 or ( less often ) below 16 . For example , in Kentucky , the lowest age a juvenile may be tried as an adult , no matter how heinous the crime , is 14 . </P> <P> The death penalty for those who have committed a crime while under the age of 18 was discontinued by the U.S. Supreme Court case Roper v. Simmons in 2005 . The court 's 5 -- 4 decision was written by Justice Kennedy and joined by Justices Ginsburg , Stevens , Breyer , and Souter , and cited international law , child developmental science , and many other factors in reaching its conclusion . </P> <P> The twenty - sixth amendment to the U.S. Constitution , ratified in 1971 , granted all citizens the right to vote in every state , in every election , from the age of 18 . </P> Main article : Minors detained in the global war on terror <P> The U.S. Department of Defense took the position that they would not consider `` enemy combatants '' held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps minors unless they were less than sixteen years old . In any event , they only separated three of more than a dozen detainees under 16 from the adult prison population . Several dozen detainees between sixteen and eighteen were detained with the adult prison population . Now those under 18 are kept separate , in line with the age of majority and world expectations . </P> <P> Some states , including Florida , have passed laws that allow a person accused of an extremely heinous crime , such as murder , to be tried as an adult , regardless of age . These laws , however , have been challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union . An estimated 250,000 youth are tried , sentenced , or incarcerated as adults every year across the United States . </P> <H2> Emancipation of minors ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Emancipation of minors <P> Emancipation of minors is a legal mechanism by which a minor is no longer under the control of their parents or guardians , and is given the legal rights associated with adults . Depending on country , emancipation may happen in different manners : through marriage , attaining economic self - sufficiency , obtaining an educational degree or diploma , or participating in a form of military service . In the United States , all states have some form of emancipation of minors . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Liquor Control Act '' . State of Connecticut .

She achieved national recognition at the age of 21 while still an undergraduate at Yale University when her design was chosen in a national competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington , D.C. It is considered one of the most influential memorials of the post-World War II period . </P> <P> Lin has completed designs for other memorials , as well as for numerous public and private buildings , landscape design , and sculpture . Although Lin 's most well known sculptures and architectural work are historical memorials , she also works to memorialize nature through her environmentally themed works . In creating works which deal with the depleting environment , Lin aims to raise awareness for the environment for audiences in urban spaces . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Environmental concerns </Li> <Li> 3 Vietnam Veterans Memorial </Li> <Li> 4 Later work </Li> <Li> 5 Personal life </Li> <Li> 6 Recognition </Li> <Li> 7 Awards and honors </Li> <Li> 8 Selected works </Li> <Li> 9 Sources </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Maya Lin was born in Athens , Ohio . Her parents had migrated to the United States from China , her father in 1948 and her mother in 1949 , and settled in Ohio before Maya was born . Her father , Henry Huan Lin , born in Fuzhou , Fujian , was a ceramist and former dean of the Ohio University College of Fine Arts . Her mother , Julia Chang Lin , born in Shanghai , is a poet and taught literature at Ohio University . She is the niece of Lin Huiyin , who is an American - educated artist , poet and said to be the first female architect in modern China . Lin Juemin and Lin Yin Ming , both of whom are among the 72 martyrs of the Second Guangzhou uprising , were cousins of her grandfather . Lin Chang - min , a Hanlin of Qing dynasty and the emperor 's teacher , was the father of Lin Hui - yin and great - grandfather of Maya Lin . </P> <P> Lin has an older brother , the poet Tan Lin . Growing up , she did not have many friends and stayed home a lot . She loved school and loved to study . When she was not studying , she took independent courses from Ohio University and spent her free time casting bronzes in the school foundry . Lin , having grown up as an Asian minority , has said that she `` did n't even realize '' she was Chinese until later in life . It was not until her 30s that she had a desire to understand her cultural background . </P> <P> Lin graduated from Yale University , where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1981 and a Master of Architecture degree in 1986 . </P> <H2> Environmental concerns ( edit ) </H2> <P> Lin has stated that environmental issues have concerned her since she was very young , and she dedicated much of her time at Yale University to environmental activism . Much of her later work , after her work on memorials , focuses on the relationship that people have with their environment , which she displays in earthworks , sculptures , and installations . `` I 'm very much a product of the growing awareness about ecology and the environment al movement , '' Lin says . `` I am very drawn to landscape , and my work is about finding a balance in the landscape , respecting nature not trying to dominate it . Even the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is an earthwork . All of my work is about slipping things in , inserting an order or a structuring , yet making an interface so that in the end , rather than a hierarchy , there is a balance and tension between the man - made and the natural . '' Lin 's work centers on the concept of uncovering `` hidden histories '' to bring attention to landscapes and environments that may otherwise be inaccessible to viewers and `` deploys the concept to discuss the inextricable relationship between nature and the built environment . '' Lin 's focus on this relationship highlights the impact humanity has on the environment , and draws attention to her concerns such as global warming , endangered bodies of water , and animal extinction / endangerment . These issues are explored in what Lin calls her latest memorial , What Is Missing ? . </P> <P> Lin also sits on the Natural Resources Defense Council board of trustees . She constructs her works to have a minimal effect on the environment , utilizing recycled and sustainable materials , minimizes carbon emissions , and avoids damage to the landscapes / ecosystems she works upon . </P> <H2> Vietnam Veterans Memorial ( edit ) </H2> Vietnam War Memorial original design submission by Maya Lin <P> In 1981 , at 21 and still an undergraduate , Lin won a public design competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial , beating 1,421 other competition submissions . The black cut - stone masonry wall , with the names of 57,661 fallen soldiers carved into its face , was completed in late October 1982 and dedicated in November 1982 . The wall is granite and V - shaped , with one side pointing to the Lincoln Memorial and the other to the Washington Monument . </P> <P> Lin 's conception was to create an opening or a wound in the earth to symbolize the gravity of the loss of the soldiers . The design was initially very controversial for several reasons . It was an unconventional and non-traditional design for a war memorial . Also controversial were Lin 's Asian ethnicity , and her lack of professional experience . The memorial has since become an important pilgrimage site for relatives and friends of the American military casualties in Vietnam , and personal tokens and mementos are left at the wall daily in the casualties ' memory . In 2007 , the American Institute of Architects ranked the memorial No. 10 on their list of America 's Favorite Architecture . </P> <P> Lin believes that if the competition had not been `` blind , '' with designs submitted by name instead of number , she `` never would have won . '' She received harassment after her ethnicity was revealed . Prominent businessman and later third party presidential candidate Ross Perot called her an `` egg roll '' after it was revealed that she was Asian . Lin defended her design in front of the US Congress , and eventually , a compromise was reached . The Three Soldiers , a bronze statue of a group of soldiers and an American flag , was placed off to one side of her design . </P> <P> However , the artist 's architectural design was controversial due to particular aspects , such as the exclusion of the surviving veterans ' names as well as the dark complexion of the granite . Many argue that the memorial only honors the soldiers who lost their lives during the Vietnam War , and others believe that the color of the granite resembles disgust and sadness towards this specific war . Yet , a 50 - foot - high flagpole and an 8 - foot - high statue of three soldiers were added to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to appease any external pressures . </P> <H2> Later work ( edit ) </H2> Sculpture made of multiple wood 2x4 pieces , on display at the De Young Museum in San Francisco ( 2009 ) Maya Lin 's `` Women 's Table '' in front of the Sterling Memorial Library that commemorates the role of women at Yale University <P> Maya Lin calls herself a `` designer , '' rather than an `` architect . '' Her vision and her focus are always on how space needs to be in the future , the balance and relationship with the nature and what it means to people . She has tried to focus less on how politics influences design and more on what emotions the space would create and what it would symbolize to the user . Her belief in a space being connected and the transition from inside to outside being fluid , coupled with what a space means , has led her to create some very memorable designs . She has also worked on sculptures and landscape installations . In doing so , Lin focuses on memorializing concepts of time periods instead of direct representations of figures , creating an abstract sculptures and installations . </P> <P> Lin believes that art should be an act of every individual that is willing to say something that is new and not quite familiar . Lin describes her creative process as having a very important writing and verbal component . She first imagines an artwork verbally to understand its concepts and meanings . She believes that gathering ideas and information is especially vital in architecture , which focuses on humanity and life and requires a well - rounded mind . When a project comes her way , she tries to `` understand the definition ( of the site ) in a verbal before finding the form to understand what a piece is conceptually and what its nature should be even before visiting the site . '' In her historical memorials , such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial , the Women 's Table , and the Civil Rights Memorial , Lin tries to focus on the chronological aspect of what she is memorializing . That theme is shown in her art memorializing the changing environment and in charting the depletion of bodies of water . Lin also explores themes of juxtaposing materials and a fusion of opposites : `` I feel I exist on the boundaries . Somewhere between science and art , art and architecture , public and private , east and west ... I am always trying to find a balance between these opposing forces , finding the place where opposites meet ... existing not on either side but on the line that divides . '' </P> <P> Lin , who now owns and operates Maya Lin Studio in New York City , has designed numerous projects , including the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery , Alabama ( 1989 ) and the Wave Field outdoor installation at the University of Michigan ( 1995 ) . </P> <P> In 1995 , Lin completed Wave Field , at the University of Michigan . Lin was inspired by both diagrams of fluids in motion and photographs of ocean waves . She was intrigued by the idea of capturing and freezing the motion of water , and she wished to capture that movement in the earth , rather than through photography . That was her first experience with earthworks . </P> <P> In 1999 , Lin exhibited Il Cortile Mare ( 1998 ) of furniture design , maquettes and photos of works at the American Academy in Rome . </P> <P> In 2000 , Lin re-emerged in the public life with a book , Boundaries . Also in 2000 , she agreed to act as the artist and architect for the Confluence Project , a series of outdoor installations at historical points along the Columbia River and Snake River in the states of Washington and Oregon . It is the largest and longest project that she has undertaken so far . </P> <P> In 2004 , Lin completed an earthwork , Eleven Minute Line , in Sweden that was designed for the Wanås Foundation . Lin draws inspiration from the Serpent Mounds ( Native American burial mounds ) located in her home state , Ohio . It is meant to be a walkway for the viewers to experience , taking eleven minutes to complete . The earthwork is also inspired by Robert Smithson 's Spiral Jetty . </P> <P> In 2005 , she designed the new plaza that anchors the Claire Trevor School of the Arts at the University of California , Irvine . </P> <P> In 2006 , Lin completed Waterline , which is composed of aluminum tubing and paint . She describes the piece as a drawing instead of a sculpture . It is a to - scale representation of the Mid-Atlantic ridge , and it is installed so that viewers may walk under the underwater mountain range . There is a purposeful ambiguity to where the actual water line is in relation to the mountain range , to highlight viewers ' relationship to the environment and their effect on bodies of water . </P> <P> Also in 2006 , Lin completed her Bodies of Water series , which included representations of three bodies of water , `` The Black Sea , '' `` The Caspian Sea , '' and `` The Red Sea . '' Each sculpture is made of layers of birch plywood , and are to - scale representations of three endangered bodies of water . The sculptures are balanced on the deepest point of the sea . Lin wishes to call attention to the `` unseen ecosystems '' that people continue to pollute . </P> <P> Lin was commissioned by Ohio University to design what is known as Input in that institution 's Bicentennial Park , a landscape designed to resemble a computer punch card . The work relates to Lin 's first official connection with the university . The daughter of the late Professor Emerita of English Julia Lin and the late Henry Lin , dean emeritus of the College of Fine Arts , Maya Lin studied computer programming at the university while in high school . The installation is located in a 3.5 - acre park . It has 21 rectangles , some raised and some depressed , resembling computer punch cards , a mainstay of early programming courses . </P> <P> In 2007 , Lin installed Above and Below , an outdoor sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in Indiana . The artwork is made of aluminum tubing that has been electrolytically colored during a process called anodization . </P> <P> In 2008 , Lin completed a 30 - ton sculpture called 2 × 4 Landscape , made of many pieces of wood , which was exhibited at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum , in San Francisco . The sculpture itself is evocative of the swelling movement of water , which is juxtaposed with the dry materiality of the lumber pieces . According to Lin , 2 × 4 Landscape was her attempt to bring the experience of Wavefield ( 1995 ) indoors . The 2 × 4 pieces are also meant to be reminiscent of pixels , to evoke the `` virtual or digital space that we are increasingly occupying . '' </P> <P> In 2008 , her projects included an installation , called Wave Field , at the Storm King Art Center in Upstate New York , near the Catskills . It is the center 's first earthwork , spanning 4 acres of land , and is a larger version of her original Wave Field ( 1995 ) that focuses on the `` fusion of opposites , '' comparing the motion of water to the material of the earth . </P> <P> In 2009 Lin created the design of a building for the Museum of Chinese in America near New York City 's Chinatown , Lin attached a personal significance to the project being a Chinese - related project , explaining that she wants her two daughters to `` know that part of their heritage '' . </P> <P> That same year , Lin completed Silver River , her first work of art in the Las Vegas Strip . It is part of a public fine art collection at MGM Mirage 's CityCenter , which opened December 2009 . Lin created an 84 - foot ( 26 m ) cast of the Colorado River made entirely of reclaimed silver . With the sculpture , Lin wanted to make a statement about water conservation and the importance of the Colorado River to Nevada in terms of energy and water . The sculpture is displayed behind the front desk of the Aria Resort and Casino . </P> <P> In 2013 , Lin completed her largest work to date , A Fold in the Field . It was built from 105,000 m cubic meters of earth , covering 3 hectares . It forms part of a private collection within a sculpture park , owned by Alan Gibbs , north of Auckland , New Zealand . </P> <P> Since around 2010 , Lin has been working on what she calls `` her final memorial , '' the What Is Missing ? Foundation , to commemorate the biodiversity that has been lost in the planet 's sixth mass extinction . She aims to raise awareness about the loss of biodiversity and natural habitats by using sound , media , science , and art for temporary installations and a web - based project . What Is Missing ? exists not in one specific site but in many forms and in many places simultaneously . </P> <P> Both What is Missing and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial were referred to by the White House in its press release that announced Lin as one of the 2016 recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom . Nature and the environment have been central concerns for Lin in both her art and architecture : `` As an artist I often work in series , and so for me , I wanted my last memorial to be on a subject that I have personally been concerned with and connected to since I was a child . The last memorial is `` What Is Missing ? '' And encompasses multiple platforms , with temporary and permanent physical installations as well as an interactive online component . '' She has expressed her concerns for the goals of the Trump administration : `` I think nature is resilient -- if we protect it -- and with my background I wanted to lend a voice to the incredible threat we are under from climate change and species and habitat loss . '' </P> <P> Lin is represented by the Pace Gallery in New York City . </P> <H2> Personal life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Lin is married to Daniel Wolf , a New York photography dealer . They have two daughters , India and Rachel . She also has an older brother , who is a poet . </P> <H2> Recognition ( edit ) </H2> <P> Lin has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees from Yale University , Harvard University , Williams College , and Smith College . In 1987 she was among the youngest to be awarded an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by Yale University . </P> <P> In 1994 , she was the subject of the Academy Award - winning documentary Maya Lin : A Strong Clear Vision . Its title comes from an address she gave at Juniata College in which she spoke of the monument design process in the origin of her work ; `` My work originates from a simple desire to make people aware of their surroundings and this can include not just the physical but the psychological world that we live in . '' </P> <P> In 2002 , Lin was elected Alumni Fellow of the Yale Corporation , the governing body of Yale University ( upon whose campus sits another of Lin 's designs , the Women 's Table , designed to commemorate the role of women at Yale University ) , in an unusually public contest . Her opponent was W.

He is also the commander - in - chief of the island 's military forces , the Puerto Rico National Guard . </P> <P> The governor has a duty to enforce state laws , to convene the Legislative Assembly , the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly , to appoint government officers , to appoint Justices , and to grant pardons . Since 1948 , the governor has been elected by the people of Puerto Rico . Prior to that , the governor was appointed either by the King of Spain ( 1510 -- 1898 ) or the President of the United States ( 1898 -- 1948 ) . </P> <P> Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico vests the executive power on the governor and empowers him with the faculty to appoint officers . Law No. 104 of 1956 empowers him with the faculty to delegate functions . These two faculties in conjunction allow the governor to delegate most of his functions while continuing to be the maximum officer and head of government . </P> <P> Most of the governor 's functions are delegated to the Chief of Staff , who is charged with managing and overseeing all the executive departments and almost all executive agencies . The budget is delegated to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget while centralized planning is delegated to the President of the Planning Board . This effectively makes the governor a political figure rather than an administrative one , allowing him to set the vision for what the island should be and where it should go rather than having to be involved in its day - to - day operations . Historically , however , governors tend to be heavily involved in the day - to - day operations of the government in both internal and external affairs . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Powers </Li> <Li> 3 Eligibility </Li> <Li> 4 Elections </Li> <Li> 5 Succession </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

( April 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> See also : History of Puerto Rico , cacique , Conquistador , and Political status of Puerto Rico <P> The first known and recorded heads of government in the history of Puerto Rico were the caciques , the tribal chiefs of the natives known as Taínos that inhabited the island before the arrival of Spaniards . It is believed that the cacique rank was apparently established through democratic means . His importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his tribe rather than his warlord skills , since the Taínos were mostly a pacifist culture . Agüeybaná I is the most - well known cacique as he was the one governing all others when the Spaniards arrived in 1493 although many others existed during his period , as well as before and after him . </P> <P> Juan Ponce de León was appointed as the first Governor of Puerto Rico in 1508 and assumed the post in 1510 . In 1579 , after several others had already served as governor , Juan Ponce de León II became the first person born in Puerto Rico to assume , temporarily , the governorship of Puerto Rico . He served until , who assumed the governorship of the island that same year . </P> <P> In 1948 , Luis Muñoz Marín became the first Puerto Rican elected Governor of Puerto Rico . </P> <H2> Powers ( edit ) </H2> <P> The governor is head of the government of Puerto Rico . He has the power to veto any number of projects that the Puerto Rican Legislature wishes to pass . The governor also has the power to appoint the members of his cabinet , who in turn must be ratified by the Legislature . The governor also has the power to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court and all the lower courts of the island . </P> <P> The governor must address the legislature at the beginning of each year to present two speeches , one is the State of the Commonwealth speech and another in which the governor presents the `` Recommended Budget '' for the next fiscal year , in which the governor proposes to the state legislature a budget for the consideration of said body . He is also the commander - in - chief of the Puerto Rico National Guard and the chief diplomat . </P> La Fortaleza is the oldest governor 's mansion in continuous use in the Western Hemisphere <H2> Eligibility ( edit ) </H2> <P> On July 25 , 1952 , the Constitution of Puerto Rico was enacted by Governor Muñoz Marín after the approval by Congress and the President of the United States . Pursuant to section Three , Article IV of the Constitution of Puerto Rico , the governor must be a citizen of the United States , a resident of Puerto Rico for five consecutive years prior and at least 35 years old at the time of the election . </P> <P> The governor serves a four - year term which begins on the second day of January after the year of his election and ends on the date his successor takes office . Consecutive service is unlimited , according to the Constitution of the Island . As an example Luis Muñoz Marín , its first elected governor , served for four consecutive terms from 1949 to 1965 ; the Constitution of the Commonwealth was ratified by the people of Puerto Rico in 1952 . </P> <H2> Elections ( edit ) </H2> <P> The governor is elected by a direct vote from the people . The Puerto Rico Elections Code states that if the margin of victory of a candidate is less than 0.5 % of the votes a full recount of the election must take place . So far , only in the gubernatorial elections of 1980 and 2004 has a recount taken place . </P> <P> The last elected governor was Ricardo Rosselló who was sworn into office on January 2 , 2017 at the age of 37 . </P> <H2> Succession ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Puerto Rico governmental line of succession and Puerto Rico government transition process <P> Upon the death , resignation , or removal from office ( by impeachment and conviction ) of a sitting governor , the Secretary of State would then take the office of governor until the end of the four - year term . In case the Secretary of State is unwilling or unable to assume it , the Secretary of Justice would temporarily assume the governorship , followed by the Secretary of Treasury , the Secretary of Education , the Secretary of Labor and Human Resources , the Secretary of Transportation and Public Works , the Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce , the Secretary of Health and the Secretary of Agriculture , until the Legislative Assembly meets to elect by majority vote of all of its members a governor for the rest of the term . Other provisions exist for the transition between an incumbent governor and a governor - elect . </P> <P> Contrary to some U.S. states , if the governor is temporarily away from Puerto Rico , the Secretary of State , or in his absence the highest ranking Cabinet member in the line of succession , becomes acting governor until the governor 's return . In decades past , when off - island gubernatorial travel was infrequent , the powers of the governorship rarely devolved upon the Secretary of State or other Cabinet officers . More accessible travel have turned the acting governorship a much more common occurrence . During recent times , not only Secretary of State frequently served as acting governor , but the Secretary of Justice , and Secretary of Treasury as well . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` CSG Releases 2013 Governor Salaries '' .

The Ricardos also appear in The Lucy -- Desi Comedy Hour , and Lucy also appears in one episode of The Ann Sothern Show . </P> <P> Together , Lucy and Ricky serve as a double act . Ricky is the straight man , a character very similar to Arnaz himself ; he is a Cuban - American bandleader whose trademark song is `` Babalu '' . Red - haired Lucy is his wife , who always gets into trouble and is usually caught at it by Ricky . They have a son Ricky Ricardo , Jr. , also called `` Little Ricky '' , portrayed by child actor Richard Keith . </P> <P> Lucy 's full name ( Lucille Esmeralda Ricardo née McGillicuddy ) is given in the season 1 episodes `` Fred and Ethel Fight '' and `` The Marriage License , '' and `` The Passports '' in season 5 . Ricky gives his full name in the season 4 episode `` Hollywood Anniversary '' as Ricardo Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha , but in the season 6 episode `` Lucy Raises Tulips '' Lucy calls him `` Enrique Alberto Fernando Ricardo y de Acha III '' . </P> <P> The marriage between Caucasian Lucy and Latino Ricky marked the first appearance of an interracial marriage on an American TV show ; I Love Lucy debuted in 1951 , sixteen years before Loving v. Virginia legalized all forms of interracial marriage in all 50 states . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Marriage </Li> <Li> 3 Birth of Little Ricky </Li> <Li> 4 Hollywood </Li> <Li> 5 Europe </Li> <Li> 6 Moving to Connecticut </Li> <Li> 7 After I Love Lucy </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Much like Lucille Ball herself , Lucy McGillicuddy was born and raised in Jamestown , New York ( or West Jamestown per episode # 138 ) , to an American family of Scottish descent . In one episode in which she was asked her birthday has her giving it as August 6th ( also the same as Ball 's ) , though in typical fashion for her she refused to give the year , but in another where she 's forced to tell the truth has her saying she was 33 years old - the episode aired during the third season in 1953 . In the episode , her parents are never referred to by name , and only her mother ( portrayed by Kathryn Card ) is seen over the course of the series . No other family is even mentioned , except for a passing reference to her grandmother being Swedish ( Jamestown has a large Swedish community ) . In Season 5 , episode 11 - `` The Passports '' it 's established she was born in 1921 , exactly ten years younger than Ball in real life . In grammar school , she played a petunia in a recital . In high school , she was involved in the drama program , wherein she studied with Miss Hanna and played Juliet Capulet in Romeo and Juliet . She also played the saxophone in high school ( as did the real Lucy ) , though every song she played sounded like `` The Glow - Worm . '' Lucy also knows how to play the ukulele . She is seen playing a ukulele in episodes `` Ricky Loses His Voice '' , `` Don Juan is Shelved '' , and `` Little Ricky Gets Stage Fright '' . </P> <P> A reference to Lucille 's attendance at an unnamed junior college is made in the episode `` Fan Magazine Interview '' ( 1954 ) ; Jamestown Community College , the nearest junior college to Lucy 's hometown , did not exist until 1950 , although a business college and nursing school did exist in the city at the time . </P> <H2> Marriage ( edit ) </H2> <P> When she was 22 , Lucy was set up on a blind date by her friend Marion Strong . Her blind date turned out to be a Cuban conga drummer , Ricky Ricardo . The two fell in love and eventually got married at the Byram River Beagle Club in Connecticut . An alternate scenario given to guest star Hedda Hopper in the Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour episode `` Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana , '' with Lucy and friend Susie McNamara ( Ann Sothern , reprising her role from Private Secretary ) , is that Lucy met Ricky while vacationing in Cuba in 1940 . </P> <P> In the early 1940s , Lucy and Ricky moved into an old reconverted brownstone apartment at 623 East 68th Street in New York City ( references made during the series date the move to 1940 or 1943 ) . The apartment rented for $105 per month . Their landlords ( soon to be best friends ) were Fred and Ethel Mertz . </P> <P> Lucy and Ethel quickly became best friends , even though Ethel was older than Lucy . Upon moving to the city , Ricky ended up getting a job headlining the Club Tropicana where they were held over indefinitely . To Lucy , Ricky 's career and days seemed so much more exciting than her days of cooking and cleaning . She desperately wanted to be a star and constantly tried to get into Ricky 's act . Ricky wanted his wife to stay home and complete her homemaking duties . However , in spite of Ricky 's reluctance and usual refusal to give her a part , Lucy usually found a way into the show . </P> <H2> Birth of Little Ricky ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1952 , after going to the doctor complaining of feeling `` dauncey '' ( a word her grandmother made up ; Lucy 's definition of feeling `` dauncey '' is when you 're not really sick but just feel lousy ) and gaining weight , she learns that she is pregnant . It is actually Ethel who first suggests to Lucy she may be expecting , even before Lucy heads out to the doctor . Lucy is very excited to tell her husband the exciting news . The Mertzes learn the news first and are sworn to secrecy . When she was younger , Lucy had envisioned how she would tell her husband they were going to have a baby . She decides to tell Ricky when he comes home for lunch that afternoon . However , with repeated interruptions from the telephone and the Mertzes , she is unable . She tries to tell him down at his club during rehearsals , but is uncomfortable telling him such a personal thing in front of his band , so she runs out crying . Finally , that evening , while Ricky is performing , Lucy pens a note and passes it to the maître d'hotel . He gives the note to Ricky . Ricky reads the note , which alludes to a wife 's needing to tell her husband they were having a baby , during one of his songs . Ricky , unaware that the `` husband '' mentioned in the note is he , wants to bring the expectant couple up on stage to congratulate them . He goes from couple to couple trying to find them . Ricky notices Lucy in the audience , and it occurs to him that Lucy may be the one who is expecting . Lucy nods yes , and Ricky is overcome with emotion . They sing `` We 're Having a Baby '' , with Lucille Ball actually breaking down in tears during the scene , which made it one of the most genuinely touching moments in television history . </P> <P> During her pregnancy , Lucy experiences the normal pregnancy woes . She becomes depressed when everyone seems to focus their attention on the impending child and not on Lucy . She can not decide on a name for the child and is nervous that she wo n't be a good mother . However , she wants the best for her child and enrolls herself , Ricky , and the Mertzes in elocution lessons to make sure her child learns how to speak properly . Finally , she takes up sculpting so she and Ricky can enrich their child 's life with art and music . </P> <P> Lucy 's show business aspirations never wane however . She manages to break into Ricky 's ( barbershop quartet ) number by firing the man who has the part she wants . </P> <P> Finally , on January 19 , 1953 ( the same day she had her real - life son Desi Arnaz , Jr . ) while husband Ricky is performing a voodoo act at his nightclub , Lucy gives birth to Ricky Ricardo , Jr . The Mertzes are named Little Ricky 's godparents . Little Ricky grows on a season - by - season basis , and by the sixth season ( 1957 ) he has started school and learned to play the drums and speak Spanish fluently . </P> <H2> Hollywood ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1954 , Lucy 's husband is given a role in an upcoming MGM film based on the life of Don Juan . Lucy and the Mertzes followed Ricky on his journey to Hollywood stardom . While in Hollywood , Lucy meets many famous celebrities , including William Holden , Hedda Hopper , Rock Hudson , Cornel Wilde , Harpo Marx , Richard Widmark , Van Johnson , and John Wayne . Some of these actors are celebrities that Ricky has already met as a result of his show business work . She reports having spotted 99 celebrities while in Hollywood and finally procures an even 100 when she meets Wilde . Lucy is incredibly starstruck and saves anything that had even come in contact with a celebrity , such as a can smashed by Cary Grant 's left rear wheel . However , she does n't merely hob nob with celebrities ; she also gets a few chances to break into show business herself . </P> <P> Ricky gets her a small role in a film as a showgirl . Lucy 's role requires her to wear a large headdress ; she also gets a death scene . However , the headdress proves cumbersome , and her part is downgraded . She eventually ends up as a showgirl who is already dead on a stretcher when the scene begins . Lucy 's second foray into show business is when she replaces Van Johnson 's sick redheaded partner in his act at the hotel . She wants to impress her friend Carolyn Appleby and successfully coaxes Johnson give her the job through flattery . She does an excellent job and impresses the crowd . Finally , she has her third shot at stardom when she appears with a Ricky Ricardo dummy at a luncheon for movie executives . Ricky was asked to perform , but he declined in favor of a fishing trip he had planned . Lucy accepted on his behalf and schemed to build the dummy and then pretend that he 's ill , and she finishes the show herself . Her plan does n't go as well as she had hoped , but she 's still a smash success and is offered a contract . She declines however , when she realizes that it would take her away from her husband and son . </P> <H2> Europe ( edit ) </H2> <P> Very soon after returning home from Hollywood , Ricky 's band is given a chance to tour around Europe . Lucy and the Mertzes again tag along on the trip and get a once in a lifetime opportunity . They sail on a cruise ship across the Atlantic , where Lucy wins a ping pong trophy . She also manages to get stuck in a porthole . </P> <P> After landing in England , Lucy gets the chance to perform for and meet Queen Elizabeth . She also participates in a fox hunt and gets to stay at a real English estate . </P> <P> In Paris , she meets Charles Boyer and is temporarily detained in a French jail after inadvertently trying to use counterfeit money . Also , she stomps on grapes in Turo , a winemaking town in Italy , and wrestles ( and is nearly drowned by ) her professional grape - stomping partner in a grape vat . </P> <H2> Moving to Connecticut ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1956 , Lucy and her husband Ricky decide to move to Connecticut after making a trip there , and Lucy falls in love with the area . Before they move in , though , she tries ( unsuccessfully ) to get out of the deal . Soon the Ricardos decide to raise chickens and sell the eggs . To help them with their business , their best friends , Fred Mertz and Ethel Mertz , move into their guest house . ( Fred was raised on a farm . ) Lucy and Ricky also make close friends while in Connecticut , Betty and Ralph Ramsey ( the Ricardos ' next door neighbors ) . </P> <H2> After I Love Lucy ( edit ) </H2> <P> I Love Lucy and The Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour concluded in the aftermath of Arnaz and Ball 's real - life divorce in 1960 , an incident that was not written into the script . Both characters remained married to each other at the end of the series ' run . </P> <P> Lucille Ball would go on to perform Lucy Ricardo - inspired characters on her ensuing sitcoms : The Lucy Show , Here 's Lucy , and the short - lived Life with Lucy . In each series , the character Ball portrayed ( each one named Lucy ) was a widow or divorceé . In the mid-1960s , she was involved in a lawsuit against Jess Oppenheimer , the co-creator of I Love Lucy , over the similarities among the separate Lucy characters . The dispute was later settled out of court . </P> <P> Arnaz only portrayed a similar Ricky Ricardo character once after The Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour ended its run : in a recurring role on The Mothers - in - Law , Arnaz portrayed matador Raphael Delgado , with the same accent and personality as Ricky ( as a Desilu production , The Mothers - in - Law used many of the same writers and executive staff as the Lucy shows ) . </P> <P> Other television series , especially those created by Desilu ( the production company Arnaz and Ball co-founded ) sought to copy the Lucy Ricardo theme . Even Janis Paige , in her short - lived Desilu - produced CBS sitcom It 's Always Jan , wore her hair like Lucy 's , and Cara Williams followed the Lucy Ricardo format in Pete and Gladys , which lasted only two seasons on CBS . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ TV Acres : Nicknames - `` B '' </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ In the I Love Lucy episode `` The Operetta , '' Lucy is the treasurer of The Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League .

{"document_text": "Odorizer - wikipedia <H1> Odorizer </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> An odorizer is a device that adds an odorant to a gas . The most common type is one that adds a mercaptan liquid into natural gas distribution systems so that leaks can be readily detected . Other types have been used for carbon dioxide fire extinguishers . </P> <P> A major spur to the development of gas odorants and odorizers was the March 18 , 1937 natural gas leak that blew up a school in New London , Texas , killing 294 children and teachers . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Natural gas odorizers </Li> <Li> 2 Wick type odorizers </Li> <Li> 3 Absorption bypass odorizers </Li> <Li> 4 Liquid injection type odorizers </Li> <Li> 5 Other odorizers <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers </Li> <Li> 5.2 Mine gas warning systems </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Natural gas odorizers ( edit ) </H2> <P> Natural gas odorizers run the gamut from a simple wick in a container to computerized equipment , which controls the amount of odorant based on flow rate , tracks the amount of odorant in inventory , and alarms when odorant is not being injected into the gas stream . </P> <P> Odorants used for natural gas vary from country to country , depending on gas distribution regulations . Some odorants contain sulfur , which is oxidized to sulfur dioxide when the gas is burned . </P> <P> Sulfur containing odorants include : </P> <Ul> <Li> tert - Butylthiol ( TBM ) the main ingredient in many gas odorant blends </Li> <Li> Tetrahydrothiophene ( THT ) , used as an odorant for natural gas , usually in mixtures containing tert - butylthiol </Li> <Li> 2 - Propanethiol , commonly known as isopropyl mercaptan ( IPM ) is used as an odorant for natural gas usually in mixtures containing tert - butylthiol </Li> <Li> Ethanethiol ( EM ) , commonly known as ethyl mercaptan is used in Liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) , and resembles odor of leeks , onions , durian , or cooked cabbage </Li> <Li> Dimethyl sulfide ( DMS ) , a component of the smell produced from cooking of certain vegetables , notably maize , cabbage , beetroot , and seafoods </Li> </Ul> <P> Non-sulfur containing odorants include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Methyl acrylate ( MA ) </Li> <Li> Ethyl acrylate ( EA ) </Li> <Li> Methylethyl pyrazine , odor of various foods including coffee and wines </Li> </Ul> <H2> Wick type odorizers ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wick type odorizers can be very small , odorizing the gas for as few as one gas customer to much larger ones that can odorize the gas for a small town ( 10,000 MCF ) . They use a wick which is very similar to those used in a kerosene lantern . The odorant is drawn up the wick from the container and into the gas stream . </P> <H2> Absorption bypass odorizers ( edit ) </H2> <P> Absorption bypass odorizers take a portion of the gas stream , the amount being dependent on the flow of gas in the line , and run it through a tank containing liquid odorant . The gas is passed over the top of the liquid . Variations exist where wicks are utilized to increase odorant vaporization . </P> <H2> Liquid injection type odorizers ( edit ) </H2> <P> For very high volume systems ( and for some smaller volume systems ) , liquid injection odorizers are being manufactured . These odorizers work by the addition of small amounts of liquid odorant to the moving gas . A pump that can be controlled to give the range of addition rates necessary is a very important aspect of this type of odorizer . Computer control to monitor flow rates and vary injection rate is a significant part of the more modern versions of this . Previous versions worked off a variety of schemes to control the odorization level . </P> <P> The Peerless odorizer was the first example of this type of odorizer . The Peerless natural - gas odorizer was recognized as a Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1992 . This odorizer was said to have been developed in response to the New London School explosion that occurred in March 1937 . It was first shipped in July 1937 , the Peerless odorizer overcame two of the major problems of previous devices : </P> <Ol> <Li> Peerless avoided problems with leaky shaft seals , by encapsulating the entire unit within a pressure vessel . </Li> <Li> Peerless added odorant in proportion to the gas flow , by using a gas meter to drive the odorant pump . </Li> </Ol> <H2> Other odorizers ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers ( edit ) </H3> <P> Odorizers are used in carbon dioxide fire extinguisher systems , the odorizer assembly injects wintergreen oil into the carbon dioxide stream when the agent is discharged . Approximately 50 cc of wintergreen oil contained within a frangible glass cartridge is mounted within a protective housing attached to the discharge piping in such a manner as to rupture the glass container when the carbon dioxide manifold is pressurized during discharge , atomizing the oil and dispersing it . The strong wintergreen scent effectively notifies the occupants of the presence of carbon dioxide gas after carbon dioxide has been discharged into the hazard . </P> <H3> Mine gas warning systems ( edit ) </H3> <P> Similar systems are used in mines , where ampoules of ethanethiol are broken in front of ventilation fans to warn of gas in the mines . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Meyer , Winston C. `` Small Station Odorizers '' ( 1993 ) .

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval , and excess , creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream . </P> <P> Fitzgerald -- inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's north shore -- began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , `` something new -- something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . '' Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue . </P> <P> First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly ; in its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies . Fitzgerald died in 1940 , believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten . However , the novel experienced a revival during World War II , and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades . Today , The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title `` Great American Novel '' . In 1998 , the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century 's best American novel and second best English - language novel of the same time period . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Historical context </Li> <Li> 2 Plot summary </Li> <Li> 3 Major characters </Li> <Li> 4 Writing and production </Li> <Li> 5 Cover art </Li> <Li> 6 Title </Li> <Li> 7 Themes </Li> <Li> 8 Symbolism </Li> <Li> 9 Reception </Li> <Li> 10 Legacy and modern analysis </Li> <Li> 11 Adaptations <Ul> <Li> 11.1 Ballet </Li> <Li> 11.2 Computer games </Li> <Li> 11.3 Film and television </Li> <Li> 11.4 Literature </Li> <Li> 11.5 Opera </Li> <Li> 11.6 Radio </Li> <Li> 11.7 Theater </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 Notes </Li> <Li> 14 References <Ul> <Li> 14.1 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 15 Further reading </Li> <Li> 16 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Historical context ( edit ) </H2> <P> Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922 , The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative . That era , known for widespread economic prosperity , the development of jazz music , flapper culture , new technologies in communication ( motion pictures , broadcast radio , recorded music ) forging a genuine mass culture , and bootlegging , along with other criminal activity , is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald 's novel . Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby 's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald 's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby 's fortune . Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book 's plotline within the historical context of the era . </P> <P> Fitzgerald 's visits to Long Island 's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby 's setting . Today , there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book . One possibility is Land 's End , a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party . Many of the events in Fitzgerald 's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota , and , like Nick , he was educated at an Ivy League school , Princeton ( in Nick 's case , Yale ) . Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved . Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant and was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery , Alabama . There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen - year - old beauty named Zelda Sayre . Zelda finally agreed to marry him , but her preference for wealth , fun , and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success . Like Nick in The Great Gatsby , Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting , and , like Gatsby , he had always idolized the very rich . In many ways , The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald 's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age . Like Gatsby , Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted , even as she led him toward everything he despised . </P> <P> In her book Careless People : Murder , Mayhem and the Invention of ' The Great Gatsby ( 2013 ) , Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall - Mills Case . Based on her forensic search for clues , she asserts that the two victims in the Hall - Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby . </P> <H2> Plot summary ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the summer of 1922 , Nick Carraway , a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwest -- who serves as the novel 's narrator -- takes a job in New York as a bond salesman . He rents a small house on Long Island , in the fictional village of West Egg , next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby , a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them . Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin , Daisy Fay Buchanan , and her husband , Tom , a college acquaintance of Nick 's . They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker , an attractive , cynical young golfer . She reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress , Myrtle Wilson , who lives in the `` valley of ashes '' , an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City . Not long after this revelation , Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment where Tom keeps his affairs with Myrtle and others . At Tom 's New York apartment , a vulgar and bizarre party takes place . It ends with Tom breaking Myrtle 's nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy 's name several times . </P> The Plaza Hotel in the early 1920s <P> Nick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby 's parties . Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party and they meet Gatsby himself , an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War . Through Jordan , Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917 when Daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services ' work with young officers headed to Europe . From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time , Gatsby became ( and still is ) deeply in love with Daisy . Gatsby had hoped that his wild parties would attract an unsuspecting Daisy , who lived across the bay , to appear at his doorstep and allow him to present himself as a man of wealth and position . </P> <P> Having developed a budding friendship with Nick , Gatsby uses him to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy . Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house without telling her that Gatsby will also be there . After an initially awkward reunion , Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair over the summer . At a luncheon at the Buchanans ' house , Daisy speaks to Gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that Tom realizes she is in love with Gatsby . Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair , he is outraged by his wife 's infidelity . He forces the group to drive into New York City and confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel , asserting that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand . In addition to that , he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities . Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom , and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby , attempting to prove that Gatsby can not hurt her . </P> <P> On the way back , Gatsby 's car strikes and kills Tom 's mistress , Myrtle . Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy , not Gatsby himself , was driving the car at the time of the accident . Myrtle 's husband , George Wilson , falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he suspects she has . He learns that the yellow car is Gatsby 's , fatally shoots him and then turns the gun on himself . Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby which none of Gatsby 's associates attend and only one of his partygoers ( besides Nick ) attends . Later , Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that the yellow car was Gatsby 's and gave him Gatsby 's address . Disillusioned with the East , Nick moves back to the Midwest . </P> <H2> Major characters ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Nick Carraway -- a Yale University graduate originating from the Midwest , a World War I veteran , and , at the start of the plot , a newly arrived resident of West Egg , who is aged 29 ( later 30 ) . He also serves as the first - person narrator of the novel . He is Gatsby 's next - door neighbor and a bond salesman . He is easy - going , occasionally sarcastic , and somewhat optimistic , although this latter quality fades as the novel progresses . He is a more grounded character than the others , and more practical , and is always in awe of other characters ' lifestyles and morals . </Li> <Li> Jay Gatsby ( originally James `` Jimmy '' Gatz ) -- a young , mysterious millionaire with shady business connections ( later revealed to be a bootlegger ) , originally from North Dakota . He is obsessed with Daisy Buchanan , a beautiful debutante from Louisville , Kentucky whom he had met when he was a young military officer stationed at the Army 's Camp Taylor in Louisville during World War I . The character is based on the bootlegger and former World War I officer , Max Gerlach , according to Some Sort of Epic Grandeur , Matthew J. Bruccoli 's biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald . Gatsby is said to have briefly studied at Trinity College , Oxford in England after the end of World War I . </Li> <Li> Daisy Fay Buchanan -- an attractive though shallow and self - absorbed , young Louisville , Kentucky debutante and socialite , identified as a flapper . She is Nick 's second cousin , once removed , and the wife of Tom Buchanan . Daisy once had a romantic relationship with Gatsby , before she married Tom . Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in the novel . Daisy is believed to have been inspired by Fitzgerald 's own youthful romances with Ginevra King . </Li> <Li> Thomas `` Tom '' Buchanan -- a millionaire who lives on East Egg , and Daisy 's husband . Tom is an imposing man of muscular build with a `` husky tenor '' voice and arrogant demeanor . He is a former football star at Yale University . Buchanan has parallels with William Mitchell , the Chicagoan who married Ginevra King . Buchanan and Mitchell were both Chicagoans with an interest in polo . Like Ginevra 's father , whom Fitzgerald resented , Buchanan attended Yale and is a white supremacist . </Li> <Li> Jordan Baker -- A professional golfer and Daisy Buchanan 's long - time friend with a sarcastic streak and an aloof attitude . She is Nick Carraway 's girlfriend for most of the novel , though they grow apart towards the end . She has a slightly shady reputation amongst the New York social elite , due to her habit of being evasive and untruthful with her friends and lovers . She established herself as a professional golfer in a predominantly male sport . With great success came criticism as she faced a scandal of cheating , which harmed her reputation as a golfer . Fitzgerald told Maxwell Perkins that Jordan was based on the golfer Edith Cummings , a friend of Ginevra King . Her name is a play on the two popular automobile brands , the Jordan Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle , alluding to Jordan 's `` fast '' reputation and the freedom now presented to Americans , especially women , in the 1920s . </Li> <Li> George B. Wilson -- a mechanic and owner of a garage . He is disliked by both his wife , Myrtle Wilson , and Tom Buchanan , who describes him as `` so dumb he does n't know he 's alive '' . At the end of the novel , he kills Gatsby , wrongly believing he had been driving the car that killed Myrtle , and then kills himself . </Li> <Li> Myrtle Wilson -- George 's wife , and Tom Buchanan 's mistress . Myrtle , who possesses a fierce vitality , is desperate to find refuge from her complacent marriage . She is accidentally killed by Gatsby 's car ( driven by Daisy , though Gatsby insists he would take the blame for the accident ) . </Li> <Li> Meyer Wolfshiem -- a Jewish friend and mentor of Gatsby 's , described as a gambler who fixed the World Series . Wolfshiem appears only twice in the novel , the second time refusing to attend Gatsby 's funeral . He is a clear allusion to Arnold Rothstein , a New York crime kingpin who was notoriously blamed for the Black Sox Scandal which tainted the 1919 World Series . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Writing and production ( edit ) </H2> The now - demolished Beacon Towers served as an inspiration for Gatsby 's home Oheka Castle was another North Shore inspiration for the novel 's setting <P> Fitzgerald began planning his third novel in June 1922 , but it was interrupted by production of his play , The Vegetable , in the summer and fall . The play failed miserably , and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production . The stories were , in his words , `` all trash and it nearly broke my heart , '' although included among those stories was `` Winter Dreams '' , which Fitzgerald later described as `` a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea '' . </P> <P> After the birth of their child , the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck , New York , on Long Island , in October 1922 . The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald 's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner , actor Lew Fields , and comedian Ed Wynn . These figures were all considered to be `` new money '' , unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula , places which were home to many of New York 's wealthiest established families , and which sat across the bay from Great Neck . This real - life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for `` West Egg '' and `` East Egg '' . In this novel , Great Neck ( King 's Point ) became the `` new money '' peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington ( Sands Point ) the old - money East Egg . Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby 's home , such as Oheka Castle and Beacon Towers , since demolished . </P> <P> By mid-1923 , Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel but discarded most of his new story as a false start , some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story `` Absolution '' . </P> <P> Work on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924 . Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger , `` Out of woods at last and starting novel . '' He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a `` consciously artistic achievement '' and a `` purely creative work -- not trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world . '' He added later , during editing , that he felt `` an enormous power in me now , more than I 've ever had . '' Soon after this burst of inspiration , work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera , where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed . By August , however , Fitzgerald was hard at work and completed what he believed to be his final manuscript in October , sending the book to his editor , Maxwell Perkins , and agent , Harold Ober , on October 30 . The Fitzgeralds then moved to Rome for the winter . Fitzgerald made revisions through the winter after Perkins informed him in a November letter that the character of Gatsby was `` somewhat vague '' and Gatsby 's wealth and business , respectively , needed `` the suggestion of an explanation '' and should be `` adumbrated '' . </P> <P> Content after a few rounds of revision , Fitzgerald returned the final batch of revised galleys in the middle of February 1925 . Fitzgerald 's revisions included an extensive rewriting of Chapter VI and VIII . Despite this , he refused an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights in order not to delay the book 's publication . He had received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and $1,981.25 upon publication . </P> <H2> Cover art ( edit ) </H2> <P> The cover of the first printing of The Great Gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature . It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline , with images of naked women reflected in the irises . A little - known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it . The cover was completed before the novel ; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had `` written it into '' the novel . Fitzgerald 's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T.J. Eckleburg ( depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson 's auto repair shop ) which Fitzgerald described as `` blue and gigantic -- their retinas are one yard high . They look out of no face , but instead , from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose . '' Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting , a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the `` girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs . '' Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read , he immediately disliked the cover , but `` Scott told me not to be put off by it , that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story . He said he had liked the jacket and now he did n't like it . '' </P> <H2> Title ( edit ) </H2> <P> Fitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly choosing The Great Gatsby , a title inspired by Alain - Fournier 's Le Grand Meaulnes . Prior , Fitzgerald shifted between Gatsby ; Among Ash - Heaps and Millionaires ; Trimalchio ; Trimalchio in West Egg ; On the Road to West Egg ; Under the Red , White , and Blue ; The Gold - Hatted Gatsby ; and The High - Bouncing Lover . The titles The Gold - Hatted Gatsby and The High - Bouncing Lover came from Fitzgerald 's epigraph for the novel , one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D'Invilliers . He initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio , the crude parvenu in Petronius 's Satyricon , and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel : `` It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night -- and , as obscurely as it had begun , his career as Trimalchio was over . '' Unlike Gatsby 's spectacular parties , Trimalchio participated in the audacious and libidinous orgies he hosted but , according to Tony Tanner 's introduction to the Penguin edition , there are subtle similarities between the two . </P> <P> In November 1924 , Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that `` I have now decided to stick to the title I put on the book ... Trimalchio in West Egg '' but was eventually persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people would not be able to pronounce it . His wife , Zelda , and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby and the next month Fitzgerald agreed . A month before publication , after a final review of the proofs , he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold - Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it . On March 19 , 1925 , Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red , White and Blue , but it was at that stage too late to change . The Great Gatsby was published on April 10 , 1925 . Fitzgerald remarked that `` the title is only fair , rather bad than good . '' </P> <P> Early drafts of the novel entitled Trimalchio : An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published . A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby 's dream in Trimalchio . Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even , although Daisy still returns to Tom . </P> <H2> Themes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sarah Churchwell sees The Great Gatsby as a `` cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream . '' The story deals with the limits and realities of America 's ideals of social and class mobility ; and the inevitably hopeless lower class aspirations to rise above the station ( s ) of their birth . The book in stark relief through the narrator , Nick Carraway , observes that : `` ... a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth . '' Using elements of irony and tragic ending , it also delves into themes of excesses of the rich , and recklessness of youth . Journalist Nick Gillespie sees The Great Gatsby as a story `` underlying permanence of class differences ; even in the face of a modern economy 's attempt to assert that the class structure is based ; not on status and inherited position ; but , upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone , to succeed by meeting the ever - changing demands and tastes of consumers ' needs . '' This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it ; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants ( Southern Europeans in the early 20th century , Latin Americans today ) , the nouveau riche , or successful minorities , Americans from the 1920s to the 21st century have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances . As Gillespie states , `` While the specific terms of the equation are always changing , it 's easy to see echoes of Gatsby 's basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society . '' Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history , readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby ( which has lent the novel an enduring popularity ) . </P> <P> Later critical writings on The Great Gatsby , following the novel 's revival , focus in particular on Fitzgerald 's disillusionment with the American Dream -- life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness -- in the context of the hedonistic Jazz Age , a name for the era which Fitzgerald said he had coined . In 1970 , Roger Pearson published the article `` Gatsby : False prophet of the American Dream '' , in which he states that Fitzgerald `` has come to be associated with this concept of the AMERICAN Dream more than any other writer of the twentieth century '' . Pearson goes on to suggest that Gatsby 's failure to realize the American dream demonstrates that it no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as Gatsby . He concludes that the American dream pursued by Gatsby `` is , in reality , a nightmare '' , bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize its unsustainability and ultimately its unattainability . </P> <P> In addition to exploring the trials and tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age , The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme , exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan 's character the marginalization of women in the East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts . As an upper - class , white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America , Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations , including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife , mother , keeper of the house , and charming socialite . As the reader finds in the novel , many of Daisy 's choices , ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved , can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a `` beautiful little fool '' who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security . For instance , one could argue that Daisy 's ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby can be attributed to the status , security , and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides . Additionally , the theme of the female familial role within The Great Gatsby goes hand in hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great American dream -- a dream that goes unrealized for Gatsby and Daisy in Fitzgerald 's prose . </P> <H2> Symbolism ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section possibly contains original research . Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations . Statements consisting only of original research should be removed . ( June 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The symbol of the green light serves as a guiding device for understanding Gatsby 's American dream and Nick 's unreliable narration and jealousy . The green light shines across the dock from Gatsby 's house and is frequently mentioned in the background of the plot and is a symbol for money , jealousy , and sickness . Additionally , the green light outlines how Gatsby 's desire for wealth and love creates a web of problems . Throughout the novel , the protagonist becomes infatuated with `` things '' which distort his understanding of happiness . Gatsby 's fixation with possessions shine the green light of money . </P> <P> The symbol is subtle , but always present among the many conflicts occurring . The meaning of the light changes throughout the novel , but first begins as a sign of hope . Nick notes , `` he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way , and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling . Involuntarily I glanced seaward -- and distinguished nothing except a single green light , minute and far away , that might have been the end of a dock '' ) . After Nick reconnects with Daisy , he returns to his house and notices Gatsby and then , the green light is introduced . This sequence of events serves as a sign of positivity that Gatsby is reuniting with Daisy . The symbol 's meaning early on sets an optimistic tone for the novel . </P> <P> At first , the green light presents a positive correlation with Gatsby achieving the American dream . However , the green light symbol also sheds light on the competing desires of money and greed . As Gatsby attempts to become closer to his dream , his connection with Daisy fades and is tarnished by his materialism and her perplexing relationship with Tom . The green light is a combination of what is both great and flawed in the novel , especially when considering Gatsby 's dream . Fitzgerald believes the dream is `` a mirage that entices us to keep moving forward even as we are ceaselessly borne back into the past '' . His narration suggests that even as the world advances , people will also revert to history and tradition . The American dream will always be both desirable and unreachable because the perception of a `` dream '' or `` perfection '' is always changing just as characterized with Gatsby who consistently pursues love and money , but fails in the end . Evidently , the American Dream was unattainable from the beginning and the positive green light was not meant to last . </P> <P> The green light 's positivity in the beginning of the novel fails not only Gatsby , but other characters as well . After Gatsby dies , Nick tries to contact Daisy and Tom , but they have moved away and will not be returning East . Nick acknowledges , `` I see now that this has been a story of the West , after all - Tom and Gatsby Daisy and Jordan and I , were all Westerners and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life '' . Nick points out that no character , himself included , found success in the East . Nick , Gatsby , Tom and Daisy all came from the western part of the United States and Nick suggests that they may have more success staying in a location familiar to them . Again , the dream proves to be unattainable and the green light of positivity fades . </P> <P> The greatest conflict within the green light of money is that Gatsby believes money equals achieving his dream , when in fact it does not . To properly address Gatsby 's internal conflict between wealth and the American dream , I must first define what it means to achieve the American dream . The dream was a set of ideals for prosperity ; each person , no matter their class , race , or religion should have an equal opportunity to achieve success . Gatsby wanted happiness , but his happiness was defined acquiring money or things and love / Daisy in a deceitful way ; he earned money dishonestly and was chasing a married woman . Gatsby takes Daisy on an in - depth tour of his home , pointing out `` I 've got a man in England who buys me clothes . He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season '' . Gatsby 's hoping to impress Daisy with his materials from places outside of America , which she ultimately does not care about . It seems that Gatsby 's international imports are to show he 's even more sophisticated than American materialism . Gatsby is under the impression that money result in love with Daisy , but is sadly mistaken . Gatsby 's obsession with money also highlights his lack of substance or personality throughout the novel , the green light fogs his true self . Gatsby 's aggressive chase for money shows that he only cares about being wealthy . </P> <P> Nick demonstrates the green light of jealousy when the Buchanan 's have him over for dinner . Throughout the novel , Nick 's opinion of Tom and Daisy remains consistent -- and judgmental . His immediate reactions from the scene at their dinner party influence his impressions of them during the rest of the novel . Nick was taken by surprise when Daisy initially told him that she and Tom had moved East permanently ; he thought Tom would `` drift over forever seeking , a little wistfully , for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game '' . Before taking an opportunity to get to know Tom , Nick classifies him as a type of jock hero he knew from college that happens to be dating his cousin . Nick did not anticipate the couple staying together long . Already , Nick is making judgments about Tom , something he promised he would not do , and he is demonstrating jealousy . He views Tom as a transparent upper - class member , and assumes he is the same person he was in college , years later . Nick 's ability to assume Tom 's character comes very easy to him . Additionally , Nick 's speculation about Tom is an early indicator that he favors Gatsby . Nick sees no depth to Tom 's character and finds him unimpressive . Unfortunately , Fitzgerald using Nick as the sole point of view throughout the novel , gives readers a biased view on Tom , deeming Nick 's narration unfair . Additionally , Nick summarizes Tom before the dinner party ; his mind is made up about him from years ago when the two attended Yale together . Thus , Nick 's claim of `` reserving judgment '' was insincere from the very beginning and his college jealousy is revealed . </P> <P> Nick 's judgement transitions from Tom to Daisy during their first encounter at dinner . A green light of sickness is revealed when he reunites with Daisy . Nick notes , `` her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it , bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth '' ) . Nick senses that Daisy is unhappy even though he knows her to be a lively person . Nick wants Gatsby to be easily understood and is thrown off when she proves to be otherwise . When Tom and Daisy excuse themselves from the table at their dinner gathering , Jordan tells Nick about Tom 's `` woman in New York '' . Nick first has sympathy for Daisy 's sadness until learning that she is indeed aware of Tom 's affair . After leaving the dinner party Nick says , `` I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away . It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house , child in arms - but apparently , there were no such intentions in her head '' . Nick is sick about Daisy 's decision , but does n't take into consideration why she is staying with Tom through his infidelity and immediately judges the couple . Nick does not consider the many reasons why Daisy would stay with Tom , but instead assumes the worst of the pair . Also , Nick 's opinion that Daisy should drive away with her baby is a harsh statement for someone who is not in her position , has never been married , and does not have a child . Nick 's first interactions with other characters convey his judgmental nature . Additionally , Nick becomes sick when Daisy does n't stand up for herself in front of Tom . </P> <P> At the end of the novel the green light has reached its final meaning . Nick claims , `` Gatsby believed in the green light , the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us . It eluded us then , but that 's no matter -- to - morrow we will run farther , stretch out our arms farther ... . '' . Fitzgerald narrates that the money and hope the green light has provided for characters , is ultimately unattainable . Nick analyzes this symbol precisely through the `` orgastic future '' : Gatsby continuously aims for a climax that will come and go . The green light displays the overarching picture of the novel by symbolizing Gatsby 's American dream , since it is ever changing and unattainable . As the green light fades throughout the novel , so does Gatsby 's dream . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Great Gatsby was published by Charles Scribner 's Sons on April 10 , 1925 . Fitzgerald called Perkins on the day of publication to monitor reviews : `` Any news ? '' `` Sales situation doubtful , '' read a wire from Perkins on April 20 , `` ( but ) excellent reviews . '' Fitzgerald responded on April 24 , saying the cable `` depressed '' him , closing the letter with `` Yours in great depression . '' Fitzgerald had hoped the novel would be a great commercial success , perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies . By October , when the original sale had run its course , the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies . Despite this , Scribner 's continually kept the book in print ; they carried the original edition on their trade list until 1946 , by which time Gatsby was in print in three other forms and the original edition was no longer needed . Fitzgerald received letters of praise from contemporaries T.S. Eliot , Edith Wharton , and Willa Cather regarding the novel ; however , this was private opinion , and Fitzgerald feverishly demanded the public recognition of reviewers and readers . </P> <P> The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day . Generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was Edwin Clark of The New York Times , who felt the novel was `` A curious book , a mystical , glamourous ( sic ) story of today . '' Similarly , Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times wrote , `` ( the novel ) leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder '' , calling the book `` a revelation of life '' and `` a work of art . '' The New York Post called the book `` fascinating ... His style fairly scintillates , and with a genuine brilliance ; he writes surely and soundly . '' The New York Herald Tribune was unimpressed , but referred to The Great Gatsby as `` purely ephemeral phenomenon , but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine - so light , so delicate , so sharp ... a literary lemon meringue . '' In The Chicago Daily Tribune , H.L. Mencken called the book `` in form no more than a glorified anecdote , and not too probable at that , '' while praising the book 's `` careful and brilliant finish . '' </P> <P> Several writers felt that the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald 's previous works and promptly criticized him . Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald 's success : `` One finishes Great Gatsby with a feeling of regret , not for the fate of the people in the book , but for Mr. Fitzgerald . '' John McClure of The Times - Picayune said that the book was unconvincing , writing , `` Even in conception and construction , The Great Gatsby seems a little raw . '' Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald 's earlier novels endearing and called the book `` a minor performance ... At the moment , its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical . '' Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book 's style `` painfully forced '' , noting that the editors of the paper were `` quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to - day . '' The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point : `` All the reviews , even the most enthusiastic , not one had the slightest idea what the book was about . '' </P> <P> Fitzgerald 's goal was to produce a literary work which would truly prove himself as a writer , and Gatsby did not have the commercial success of his two previous novels , This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned . Although the novel went through two initial printings , some of these copies remained unsold years later . Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time , and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character . According to his own ledger , now made available online by University of South Carolina 's Thomas Cooper library , he earned only $2,000 from the book . Although 1926 brought Owen Davis ' stage adaption and the Paramount - issued silent film version , both of which brought in money for the author , Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and , most importantly , would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye . For several years afterward , the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece . </P> <H2> Legacy and modern analysis ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1940 , Fitzgerald suffered a third and final heart attack , and died believing his work forgotten . His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as Fitzgerald `` at his best '' . A strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles ; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book 's influence . The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson 's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment , with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction . </P> <P> In 1942 , a group of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime . The Council 's purpose was to distribute paperback books to soldiers fighting in the Second World War . The Great Gatsby was one of these books . The books proved to be `` as popular as pin - up girls '' among the soldiers , according to the Saturday Evening Post 's contemporary report . 155,000 copies of Gatsby were distributed to soldiers overseas. . </P> <P> By 1944 , full - length articles on Fitzgerald 's works were being published , and the following year , `` the opinion that Gatsby was merely a period piece had almost entirely disappeared . '' This revival was paved by interest shown by literary critic Edmund Wilson , who was Fitzgerald 's friend . In 1951 , Arthur Mizener published The Far Side of Paradise , a biography of Fitzgerald . He emphasized The Great Gatsby 's positive reception by literary critics , which may have influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it . </P> <P> By 1960 , the book was steadily selling 50,000 copies per year , and renewed interest led The New York Times editorialist Arthur Mizener to proclaim the novel `` a classic of twentieth - century American fiction '' . The Great Gatsby has sold over 25 million copies worldwide as of 2013 , annually sells an additional 500,000 copies , and is Scribner 's most popular title ; in 2013 , the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies . </P> <P> Scribner 's copyright is scheduled to expire in 2020 , according to Maureen Corrigan 's book about the making of The Great Gatsby , So We Read On . </P> <H2> Adaptations ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Ballet ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> In 2009 , BalletMet premiered a version at the Capitol Theatre in Columbus , Ohio .

{"document_text": "French colonization of the Americas - wikipedia <H1> French colonization of the Americas </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Map of North America ( 1750 ) - France ( blue ) , Britain ( pink ) , and Spain ( orange ) <P> The French colonization of the Americas began in the 16th century , and continued on into the following centuries as France established a colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere . France founded colonies in much of eastern North America , on a number of Caribbean islands , and in South America . Most colonies were developed to export products such as fish , rice sugar , and furs . </P> <P> As they colonized the New World , the French established forts and settlements that would become such cities as Quebec and Montreal in Canada ; Detroit , Green Bay , St. Louis , Cape Girardeau , Mobile , Biloxi , Baton Rouge and New Orleans in the United States ; and Port - au - Prince , Cap - Haïtien ( founded as Cap - Français ) in Haiti , Cayenne in French Guiana and São Luís ( founded as Saint - Louis de Maragnan ) in Brazil . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 North America <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Background </Li> <Li> 1.2 Colonization </Li> <Li> 1.3 French Florida </Li> <Li> 1.4 Canada and Acadia </Li> <Li> 1.5 Louisiana <Ul> <Li> 1.5. 1 The Mississippi Bubble </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.6 Dissolution </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 West Indies </Li> <Li> 3 South America <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Brazil <Ul> <Li> 3.1. 1 1557 Calvinist arrival </Li> <Li> 3.1. 2 Portuguese intervention </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.2 Equinoctial France </Li> <Li> 3.3 History of France Équinoxiale </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 Notes </Li> <Li> 6 References <Ul> <Li> 6.1 In French </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> North America ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Background ( edit ) </H3> <P> The French first came to the New World as explorers , seeking a route to the Pacific Ocean and wealth . Major French exploration of North America began under the rule of Francis I , King of France . In 1524 , Francis sent Italian - born Giovanni da Verrazzano to explore the region between Florida and Newfoundland for a route to the Pacific Ocean . Verrazzano gave the names Francesca and Nova Gallia to that land between New Spain and English Newfoundland , thus promoting French interests . </P> <H3> Colonization ( edit ) </H3> Main article : New France Portrait of Jacques Cartier by Théophile Hamel , arr. 1844 <P> In 1534 , Francis I of France sent Jacques Cartier on the first of three voyages to explore the coast of Newfoundland and the St. Lawrence River . He founded New France by planting a cross on the shore of the Gaspé Peninsula . The French subsequently tried to establish several colonies throughout North America that failed , due to weather , disease , or conflict with other European powers . Cartier attempted to create the first permanent European settlement in North America at Cap - Rouge ( Quebec City ) in 1541 with 400 settlers but the settlement was abandoned the next year after bad weather and attacks from Native Americans in the area . A small group of French troops were left on Parris Island , South Carolina in 1562 to build Charlesfort , but left after a year when they were not resupplied by France . Fort Caroline established in present - day Jacksonville , Florida , in 1564 , lasted only a year before being destroyed by the Spanish from St. Augustine . An attempt to settle convicts on Sable Island off Nova Scotia in 1598 failed after a short time . In 1599 , a sixteen - person trading post was established in Tadoussac ( in present - day Quebec ) , of which only five men survived the first winter . In 1604 Pierre Du Gua de Monts and Samuel de Champlain founded a short - lived French colony , the first in Acadia , on Saint Croix Island , presently part of the state of Maine , which was much plagued by illness , perhaps scurvy . The following year the settlement was moved to Port Royal , located in present - day Nova Scotia . </P> <P> Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec ( 1608 ) and explored the Great Lakes . In 1634 , Jean Nicolet founded La Baye des Puants ( present - day Green Bay ) , which is one of the oldest permanent European settlements in America . In 1634 , Sieur de Laviolette founded Trois - Rivières . In 1642 , Paul de Chomedey , Sieur de Maisonneuve , founded Fort Ville - Marie which is now known as Montreal . Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette founded Sault Sainte Marie ( 1668 ) and Saint Ignace ( 1671 ) and explored the Mississippi River . At the end of the 17th century , René - Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle established a network of forts going from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River . Fort Saint Louis was established in Texas in 1685 , but was gone by 1688 . Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit ( modern - day Detroit ) in 1701 and Jean - Baptiste Le Moyne , Sieur de Bienville founded La Nouvelle Orléans ( New Orleans ) in 1718 . Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville founded Baton Rouge in 1719 . </P> Governor Frontenac performing a tribal dance with Indian allies <P> . </P> <P> The French were eager to explore North America but New France remained largely unpopulated . Due to the lack of women , intermarriages between French and Indians were frequent , giving rise to the Métis people . Relations between the French and Indians were usually peaceful . As the 19th - century historian Francis Parkman stated : </P> <P> `` Spanish civilization crushed the Indian ; English civilization scorned and neglected him ; French civilization embraced and cherished him '' </P> -- Francis Parkman . <P> To boost the French population , Cardinal Richelieu issued an act declaring that Indians converted to Catholicism were considered as `` natural Frenchmen '' by the Ordonnance of 1627 : </P> <P> `` The descendants of the French who are accustomed to this country ( New France ) , together with all the Indians who will be brought to the knowledge of the faith and will profess it , shall be deemed and renowned natural Frenchmen , and as such may come to live in France when they want , and acquire , donate , and succeed and accept donations and legacies , just as true French subjects , without being required to take no letters of declaration of naturalization . '' </P> <P> Louis XIV also tried to increase the population by sending approximately 800 young women nicknamed the `` King 's Daughters '' . However , the low density of population in New France remained a very persistent problem . At the beginning of the French and Indian War ( 1754 -- 1763 ) , the British population in North America outnumbered the French 20 to 1 . France fought a total of six colonial wars in North America ( see the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . </P> See also : Franco - Indian alliance <H3> French Florida ( edit ) </H3> Map of French Florida <P> In 1562 , Charles IX , under the leadership of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny sent Jean Ribault and a group of Huguenot settlers in an attempt to colonize the Atlantic coast and found a colony on a territory which will take the name of the French Florida . They discovered the probe and Port Royal Island , which will be called by Parris Island in South Carolina , on which he built a fort named Charlesfort . The group , led by René Goulaine de Laudonnière , moved to the south where they founded the Fort Caroline on the Saint John 's river in Florida on June 22 , 1564 . </P> <P> This irritated the Spanish who claimed Florida and opposed the Protestant settlers for religious reasons . In 1565 , Pedro Menéndez de Avilés led a group of Spaniards and founded Saint Augustine , 60 kilometers south of Fort Caroline . Fearing a Spanish attack , Ribault planned to move the colony but a storm suddenly destroyed his fleet . On 20 September 1565 the Spaniards , commanded by Menéndez de Avilés , attacked and massacred all the Fort Caroline occupants including Jean Ribault . </P> <H3> Canada and Acadia ( edit ) </H3> Political map of the Northeastern part of North America in 1664 . <P> The French interest in Canada focused first on fishing off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland . However , at the beginning of the 17th century , France was more interested in fur from North America . The fur trading post of Tadoussac was founded in 1600 . Four years later , Champlain made his first trip to Canada in a trade mission for fur . Although he had no formal mandate on this trip , he sketched a map of the St. Lawrence River and in writing , on his return to France , a report entitled Savages ( Relation of his stay in a tribe of Montagnais near Tadoussac ) . </P> <P> Champlain needed to report his findings to Henry IV . He participated in another expedition to New France in the spring of 1604 , conducted by Pierre Du Gua de Monts . It helped the foundation of a settlement on Saint Croix Island , the first French settlement in the New World , which would be given up the following winter . The expedition then founded the colony of Port - Royal . </P> <P> In 1608 , Champlain founded a fur post that would become the city of Quebec , which would become the capital of New France . In Quebec , Champlain forged alliances between France and the Huron and Ottawa against their traditional enemies , the Iroquois . Champlain and other French travelers then continued to explore North America , with canoes made from Birch bark , to move quickly through the Great Lakes and their tributaries . In 1634 , the Normand explorer Jean Nicolet pushed his exploration to the West up to Wisconsin . </P> <P> Following the capitulation of Quebec by the Kirke brothers , the British occupied the city of Quebec and Canada from 1629 to 1632 . Samuel de Champlain was taken prisoner and there followed the bankruptcy of the Company of One Hundred Associates . Following the Treaty of Saint - Germain - en - Laye , France took possession of the colony in 1632 . The city of Trois - Rivières was founded in 1634 . In 1642 , the Angevin Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière founded Ville - Marie ( later Montreal ) which was at that time , a fort as protection against Iroquois attacks ( the first great Iroquois war lasted from 1642 to 1667 ) . </P> A new map of the north parts of America claimed by France in 1720 , according to the London cartographer Herman Moll . <P> Despite this rapid expansion , the colony developed very slowly . The Iroquois wars and diseases were the leading causes of death in the French colony . In 1663 when Louis XIV provided the Royal Government , the population of New France was only 2500 European inhabitants . That year , to increase the population , Louis XIV sent between 800 and 900 ' King 's Daughters ' to become the wives of French settlers . The population of New France reached subsequently 7000 in 1674 and 15000 in 1689 . </P> <P> From 1689 to 1713 , the French settlers were faced with almost incessant war during the French and Indian Wars . From 1689 to 1697 , they fought the British in the Nine Years ' War . The war against the Iroquois continued even after the Treaty of Rijswijk until 1701 , when the two parties agreed on peace . Then , the war against the English took over in the War of the Spanish Succession . In 1690 and 1711 , Quebec City had successfully resisted the attacks of the English navy and then British army . Nevertheless , the British took advantage of the second war . With the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 , France ceded to Britain Acadia ( with a population of 1700 people ) , Newfoundland and Hudson Bay . Under the Sovereign Council , the population of the colony grew faster . However , the population growth was far inferior to that of the British Thirteen Colonies to the south . In the middle of the 18th century , New France accounted for 60,000 people while the British colonies had more than one million people . This placed the colony at a great military disadvantage against the British . The war between the colonies resumed in 1744 , lasting until 1748 . A final and decisive war began in 1754 . The Canadiens and the French were helped by numerous alliances with Native Americans , but they were usually outnumbered on the battlefield . </P> <H3> Louisiana ( edit ) </H3> Louisiana before 1736 <P> On May 17 , 1673 , explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began exploring the Mississippi River , known to the Sioux as does Tongo , or to the Miami - Illinois as missisipioui ( the great river ) . They reached the mouth of the Arkansas and then up the river , after learning that it flowed into the Gulf of Mexico and not to the California Sea ( Pacific Ocean ) . </P> <P> In 1682 , the Normand Cavelier de la Salle and the Italian Henri de Tonti came down the Mississippi to its Delta . They left from Fort Crevecoeur on the Illinois River , along with 23 French and 18 Native Americans . In April 1682 , they arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi ; they planted a cross and a column bearing the arms of the king of France . La Salle returned to France and won over the Secretary of State of the Navy to give him the command of Louisiana . He believed that it was close to New Spain by drawing a map on which the Mississippi seemed much further west than its actual rate . He set up a maritime expedition with four ships and 320 emigrants , but it ended in disaster when he failed to find the Mississippi Delta and was killed in 1687 . </P> <P> In 1698 , Pierre LeMoyne d'Iberville left La Rochelle and explored the area around the mouth of the Mississippi . He stopped between Isle - aux - Chats ( now Cat Island ) and Isle Surgeres ( renamed Isle - aux - Vascular or Ship Island ) on February 13 , 1699 and continued his explorations to the mainland , with his brother Jean - Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to Biloxi . He built a precarious fort , called ' Maurepas ' ( later ' Old Biloxi ' ) , before returning to France . He returned twice in the Gulf of Mexico and established a fort at Mobile in 1702 . </P> <P> From 1699 to 1702 , Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville was governor of Louisiana . His brother succeeded him in that post from 1702 to 1713 . He was again governor from 1716 to 1724 and again 1733 to 1743 . In 1718 , Jean - Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville commanded a French expedition in Louisiana . He founded the city of New Orleans , in homage to Regent Duke of Orleans . The architect Adrian de Pauger drew the orthogonal plane of the Old Square . </P> The Mississippi bubble ( edit ) Main article : Mississippi Company In Weigel 's map ( 1719 ) intended to promote sales of the Mississippi Company in Germany ; most of the present - day United States appears under the name `` Louisiana '' . <P> In 1718 , there were only 700 Europeans in Louisiana . The Mississippi Company arranged for ships to bring 800 more , who landed in Louisiana in 1718 , doubling the European population . John Law encouraged Germans , particularly Germans of the Alsatian region who had recently fallen under French rule , and the Swiss to emigrate . </P> <P> Prisoners were set free in Paris in September 1719 onwards , under the condition that they marry prostitutes and go with them to Louisiana . The newly married couples were chained together and taken to the port of embarkation . In May 1720 , after complaints from the Mississippi Company and the concessioners about this class of French immigrants , the French government prohibited such deportations . However , there was a third shipment of prisoners in 1721 . </P> <H3> Dissolution ( edit ) </H3> <P> The last French and Indian War resulted in the dissolution of New France , with Canada going to Great Britain and Louisiana going to Spain . Only the islands of Saint - Pierre - et - Miquelon are still in French hands . </P> <P> In 1802 Spain returned Louisiana to France , but Napoleon sold it to the United States in 1803 . The French left many toponyms ( Illinois , Vermont , Bayous ... ) and ethnonyms ( Sioux , Coeur d'Alene , Nez Percé ... ) in North America . </P> <H2> West indies ( edit ) </H2> Further information : French West Indies <P> A major French settlement lay on the island of Hispaniola , where France established the colony of Saint - Domingue on the western third of the island in 1664 . Nicknamed the `` Pearl of the Antilles '' , Saint - Domingue became the richest colony in the Caribbean due to slave plantation production of sugar cane . It had the highest slave mortality rate in the western hemisphere . A 1791 slave revolt , the only ever successful slave revolt , began the Haitian Revolution , led to freedom for the colony 's slaves in 1794 and , a decade later , complete independence for the country , which renamed itself Haiti . France briefly also ruled the eastern portion of the island , which is now the Dominican Republic . </P> <P> During the 17th and 18th centuries , France ruled much of the Lesser Antilles at various times . Islands that came under French rule during part or all of this time include Dominica , Grenada , Guadeloupe , Marie - Galante , Martinique , St. Barthélemy , St. Croix , St. Kitts , St. Lucia , St. Martin , St. Vincent and Tobago . Control of many of these islands was contested between the French , the British and the Dutch ; in the case of St. Martin , the island was divided in two , a situation that persists to this day . Great Britain captured some of France 's islands during the Seven Years ' War and the Napoleonic Wars . Following the latter conflict , France retained control of Guadeloupe , Martinique , Marie - Galante , St. Barthélemy , and its portion of St. Martin ; all remain part of France today . Guadeloupe ( including Marie - Galante and other nearby islands ) and Martinique each is an overseas department of France , while St. Barthélemy and St. Martin each became an overseas collectivity of France in 2007 . </P> <H2> South America ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia 's quality standards .

( April 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Brazil ( edit ) </H3> <P> France Antarctique ( formerly also spelled France antartique ) was a French colony south of the Equator , in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , which existed between 1555 and 1567 , and had control over the coast from Rio de Janeiro to Cabo Frio . The colony quickly became a haven for the Huguenots , and was ultimately destroyed by the Portuguese in 1567 . On November 1 , 1555 , French vice-admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon ( 1510 -- 1575 ) , a Catholic knight of the Order of Malta , who later would help the Huguenots to find a refuge against persecution , led a small fleet of two ships and 600 soldiers and colonists , and took possession of the small island of Serigipe in the Guanabara Bay , in front of present - day Rio de Janeiro , where they built a fort named Fort Coligny . The fort was named in honor of Gaspard de Coligny ( then a Catholic statesman , who about a year later would become a Huguenot ) , an admiral who supported the expedition and would use the colony in order to protect his co-religionists . To the still largely undeveloped mainland village , Villegaignon gave the name of Henriville , in honour of Henry II , the King of France , who also knew of and approved the expedition , and had provided the fleet for the trip . Villegaignon secured his position by making an alliance with the Tamoio and Tupinambá Indians of the region , who were fighting the Portuguese . </P> 1557 calvinist arrival ( edit ) <P> Unchallenged by the Portuguese , who initially took little notice of his landing , Villegaignon endeavoured to expand the colony by calling for more colonists in 1556 . He sent one of his ships , the Grande Roberge , to Honfleur , entrusted with letters to King Henry II , Gaspard de Coligny and according to some accounts , the Protestant leader John Calvin . After one ship was sent to France to ask for additional support , three ships were financed and prepared by the king of France and put under the command of Sieur De Bois le Comte , a nephew of Villegagnon . They were joined by 14 Calvinists from Geneva , led by Philippe de Corguilleray , including theologians Pierre Richier and Guillaume Chartrier . The new colonists , numbering around 300 , included 5 young women to be wed , 10 boys to be trained as translators , as well as 14 Calvinists sent by Calvin , and also Jean de Léry , who would later write an account of the colony . They arrived in March 1557 . The relief fleet was composed of : The Petite Roberge , with 80 soldiers and sailors was led by Vice Admiral Sieur De Bois le Comte . The Grande Roberge , with about 120 on board , captained by Sieur de Sainte - Marie dit l'Espine . The Rosée , with about 90 people , led by Captain Rosée . Doctrinal disputes arose between Villegagnon and the Calvinists , especially in relation to the Eucharist , and in October 1557 the Calvinists were banished from Coligny island as a result . They settled among the Tupinamba until January 1558 , when some of them managed to return to France by ship together with Jean de Léry , and five others chose to return to Coligny island where three of them were drowned by Villegagnon for refusing to recant . </P> Portuguese intervention ( edit ) <P> In 1560 Mem de Sá , the new Governor - General of Brazil , received from the Portuguese government the command to expel the French . With a fleet of 26 warships and 2,000 soldiers , on 15 March 1560 , he attacked and destroyed Fort Coligny within three days , but was unable to drive off their inhabitants and defenders , because they escaped to the mainland with the help of the Native Brazilians , where they continued to live and to work . Admiral Villegaignon had returned to France in 1558 , disgusted with the religious tension that existed between French Protestants and Catholics , who had come also with the second group ( see French Wars of Religion ) . Urged by two influential Jesuit priests who had come to Brazil with Mem de Sá , named José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega , and who had played a big role in pacifying the Tamoios , Mem de Sá ordered his nephew , Estácio de Sá to assemble a new attack force . Estácio de Sá founded the city of Rio de Janeiro on March 1 , 1565 , and fought the Frenchmen for two more years . Helped by a military reinforcement sent by his uncle , on January 20 , 1567 , he imposed final defeat on the French forces and decisively expelled them from Brazil , but died a month later from wounds inflicted in the battle . Coligny 's and Villegaignon 's dream had lasted a mere 12 years . </P> <H3> Equinoctial France ( edit ) </H3> <P> Equinoctial France was the contemporary name given to the colonization efforts of France in the 17th century in South America , around the line of Equator , before `` tropical '' had fully gained its modern meaning : Equinoctial means in Latin `` of equal nights '' , i.e. , on the Equator , where the duration of days and nights is nearly the same year round . The French colonial empire in the New World also included New France ( Nouvelle France ) in North America , particularly in what is today the province of Quebec , Canada , and for a very short period ( 12 years ) also Antarctic France ( France Antarctique , in French ) , in present - day Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . All of these settlements were in violation of the papal bull of 1493 , which divided the New World between Spain and Portugal . This division was later defined more exactly by the Treaty of Tordesillas . </P> <H3> History of France Équinoxiale ( edit ) </H3> <P> France Équinoxiale started in 1612 , when a French expedition departed from Cancale , Brittany , France , under the command of Daniel de la Touche , Seigneur de la Ravardière , and François de Razilly , admiral . Carrying 500 colonists , it arrived in the Northern coast of what is today the Brazilian state of Maranhão . De la Ravardière had discovered the region in 1604 but the death of the king postponed his plans to start its colonization . The colonists soon founded a village , which was named `` Saint - Louis '' , in honor of the French king Louis IX . This later became São Luís in Portuguese , ( 1 ) the only Brazilian state capital founded by France . On 8 September , Capuchin friars prayed the first mass , and the soldiers started building a fortress . An important difference in relation to France Antarctique is that this new colony was not motivated by escape from religious persecutions to Protestants ( see French Wars of Religion ) . The colony did not last long . A Portuguese army assembled in the Captaincy of Pernambuco , under the command of Alexandre de Moura , was able to mount a military expedition , which defeated and expelled the French colonists in 1615 , less than four years after their arrival in the land . Thus , it repeated the disaster spelt for the colonists of France Antarctique , in 1567 . A few years later , in 1620 , Portuguese and Brazilian colonists arrived in number and São Luís started to develop , with an economy based mostly in sugar cane and slavery . </P> <P> French traders and colonists tried again to settle a France Équinoxiale further North , in what is today French Guiana , in 1626 , 1635 ( when the capital , Cayenne , was founded ) and 1643 . Twice a Compagnie de la France Équinoxiale was founded , in 1643 and 1645 , but both foundered as a result of misfortune and mismanagement . It was only after 1674 , when the colony came under the direct control of the French crown and a competent Governor took office , that France Équinoxiale became a reality . To this day , French Guiana is a department of France . </P> French Guiana located in the South American continent . <P> French Guiana was first settled by the French in 1604 , although its earliest settlements were abandoned in the face of hostilities from the indigenous population and tropical diseases . The settlement of Cayenne was established in 1643 , but was abandoned . It was re-established in the 1660s . Except for brief occupations by the English and Dutch in the 17th century , and by the Portuguese in the 19th century , Guiana has remained under French rule ever since . From 1851 to 1951 it was the site of a notorious penal colony , Devil 's Island ( Île du Diable ) . Since 1946 , French Guiana has been an overseas department of France . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Part of a series on </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> European colonization of the Americas </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> First wave of European colonization </Li> <Li> British </Li> <Li> Couronian </Li> <Li> Danish </Li> <Li> Dutch </Li> <Li> French </Li> <Li> German </Li> <Li> Hospitaller ( Maltese ) </Li> <Li> Norse </Li> <Li> Portuguese </Li> <Li> Russian </Li> <Li> Scottish </Li> <Li> Spanish </Li> <Li> Swedish </Li> <Li> Colonization of Canada </Li> <Li> Colonization of the United States </Li> <Li> Decolonization </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Colonialism portal </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> Atlantic World </Li> <Li> History of Canada </Li> <Li> Former colonies and territories in Canada </Li> <Li> French and Indian Wars </Li> <Li> Franco - Indian alliance </Li> <Li> French colonial empire </Li> <Li> French in Canada </Li> <Li> French in the United States </Li> <Li> French intervention in Mexico </Li> <Li> Illinois Country </Li> <Li> List of French possessions and colonies </Li> <Li> List of French forts in North America </Li> <Li> Military of New France </Li> <Li> Timeline of imperialism # Colonization of North America </Li> <Li> Canadian French </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Thomas B.

It was originally included on the album A Night at the Opera in 1975 , and later released as a single . In the US , `` You 're My Best Friend '' went to number sixteen . The ballad also appeared on the Live Killers ( 1979 ) live album and on the compilation albums Greatest Hits ( 1981 ) , Absolute Greatest ( 2009 ) and Queen Forever ( 2014 ) . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Music video </Li> <Li> 3 Composition </Li> <Li> 4 Queen comments on the record </Li> <Li> 5 Charts and certifications <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 5.2 Certifications </Li> <Li> 5.3 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Personnel </Li> <Li> 7 Cover versions </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Deacon wrote the song for his wife , Veronica Tetzlaff . In this song , he plays a Wurlitzer electric piano in addition to his bass guitar work . The characteristic `` bark '' of the Wurlitzer 's bass notes plays a prominent role in the song . During live performances , the band used a grand piano rather than an electric , and it would be played by Freddie Mercury , while Deacon played the bass guitar just like in the original recording . </P> <P> The song was used in several TV shows and films such as Hot in Cleveland , Will & Grace , EastEnders , My Name is Earl , The King of Queens , the end credits of I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry , The Simpsons , Shaun of the Dead , Peter 's Friends , and The Secret Life of Pets . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> The music video , directed by Bruce Gowers , shows the band in a huge ballroom surrounded by over one thousand candles , including a huge chandelier hung from the ceiling . The video was filmed in April 1976 at Elstree Studios , London . Additionally , Deacon is seen playing a grand piano rather than the Wurlitzer he used on the recording . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song was composed by John Deacon in the key of C major with a meter of 4 / 4 , in swing feel . </P> <P> The album A Night at the Opera features songs of numerous styles , including this three - minute pop song . Very unusual for the genre , there is no section appearing more than twice ; characteristic of many Queen songs , as affirmed by Brian May . On the other hand , in terms of phrases and measures , there are numerous repetitions or variants . The form is cyclic and very similar to that of `` Spread Your Wings '' ( 1977 ) . Another similarity between the two songs is the lack of ( real ) modulation . The arrangement features 3 and 4 - part vocal and guitar harmonies , bass ( melodic approach ) , drums , and electric piano . This is Deacon 's second recorded song and the first one released on single , some six months after the album - release . Mercury 's lead vocal features lot of `` special effects '' ( voice , rubato - ized rhythms , ornaments , slides ) . Mercury hits two sustained C s in the lead vocal track . </P> <H2> Queen comments on the record ( edit ) </H2> <P> The band answered Tom Browne on 24 December 1977 in a live BBC Radio One interview , regarding Deacon 's control of the piano for the recording : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> Well , Freddie did n't like the electric piano , so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that 's the song that came out you know when I was learning to play piano . It was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that . You know , often on the instrument that you wrote the song on . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> -- John Deacon </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I refused to play the damn thing ( the Wurlitzer ) .

In 2017 , Headey became one of the highest paid actors on television and could earn up to £ 2 million per episode of Game of Thrones ( based on shared percentages of syndication payments ) . She also played the title character Sarah Connor on Fox 's Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles and the villainous drug lord Madeline `` Ma - Ma '' Madrigal in Dredd . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Career <Ul> <Li> 2.1 1990s : Debut and early roles </Li> <Li> 2.2 2000s : Rise to prominence </Li> <Li> 2.3 2010s : Mainstream success </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Public image </Li> <Li> 4 Personal life <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Activism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Filmography </Li> <Li> 6 Awards and nominations </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Headey was born in Hamilton , Bermuda , the daughter of Sue and John Headey . Her father , a Yorkshire police officer , was stationed there at the time . She has one younger brother , Tim . The family moved to Somerset when she was five , and then to Shelley , West Yorkshire , when Headey was 11 . As a child , she took ballet lessons , before being told to stop . </P> <P> Headey had her first experience of acting when she was a pupil at Shelley College ; she was noticed at age 17 , when performing in a school production at the Royal National Theatre , and was picked for a role in the 1992 film Waterland . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1990s : debut and early roles ( edit ) </H3> <P> At the age of 17 , Headey performed in a one - off show and afterwards a casting agent took a photo and asked her to audition . Later , she got a supporting role in the drama Waterland , in which she had the opportunity to work with actors who had been in the business several years before her . She had a small role in The Remains of the Day , which came out in 1993 and received eight Academy Awards nominations . </P> <P> She played Katherine in Disney 's The Jungle Book , released in 1994 . The film had positive reviews and earned nearly $44 million in the United States . Headey , alongside her co-stars received favourable reviews with James Berardinelli praising their `` solid performances '' . On the set of The Jungle Book , she met her boyfriend of nine years , actor Jason Flemyng . </P> <P> After a number of film roles , she appeared opposite Vanessa Redgrave in the 1997 romantic drama Mrs Dalloway . Headey landed a supporting role in a higher - profile film titled Onegin , which starred Ralph Fiennes and Liv Tyler . The following year , she had the starring role in the drama Aberdeen . Headey received several good reviews for her performance in the film . She also had roles in 2000 's Gossip and 2001 's The Parole Officer . </P> <P> She received the Silver Iris Award for Best Actress at the 2001 Brussels European Film Festival for her role in Aberdeen . In 2002 , she had a role in the mystery drama Possession alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart . </P> <H3> 2000s : Rise to prominence ( edit ) </H3> Headey at the 300 London premiere , 2007 <P> Headey co-starred with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam 's The Brothers Grimm , which was released in August 2005 . The film received mixed reviews . In an interview Headey spoke about her character in the film : `` I loved the fact that she was a tomboy . That is what attracted me to her , that she was n't this predictable female character in this big film . You meet her and she is masking who she is . I loved that her environment dictated who she is . She lives and grows up and survives in the forest . Terry and I talked about how her instincts are almost animalistic and she can see 360 degrees around her . She is aware of what is going on . That is how she is grounded . She is of the earth '' . </P> <P> In 2005 , she starred with actress Piper Perabo in the films The Cave and Imagine Me & You . The Cave was not well received by critics and did poorly at the box office . </P> <P> The romantic comedy - drama Imagine Me & You received a limited release and earned positive reviews . Critics praised Headey 's performance as a lesbian in the film ; Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle stated that the actress `` has a forthright , irresistible appeal and a face and especially a smile that suggest intelligence , integrity and lots of fun '' . </P> <P> Headey played Queen Gorgo in Zack Snyder 's 300 . Headey had to do nude scenes in the film . `` It 's always weird the thought of taking your clothes off in front of 20 people and then to have it projected in front of many more '' , she told IndieLondon during an interview . `` I think it was necessary because we only get that scene to establish their relationship . It is a very obvious moment but I think it does it in quite a beautiful way . '' </P> Headey at the 2007 Scream Awards <P> In addition to her film work , Headey starred in Fox 's Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles , a television spin - off of James Cameron 's popular Terminator franchise . Headey played Sarah Connor from January 2008 to April 2009 . The show ran for 31 episodes in two seasons until its cancellation in May 2009 . Variety praised `` Headey 's gritty performance as Sarah -- managing to be smart , resourceful and tough , yet melancholy and vulnerable as well '' and that the Chronicles `` continue to deliver '' , getting `` considerable mileage out of the constant peril '' facing the characters . She was nominated twice for the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television for the role . </P> <P> Headey has also appeared in a number of independent films , such as The Red Baron , a biographical film of the legendary World War I fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen , in which she appeared alongside Matthias Schweighöfer and Joseph Fiennes . Her character was the love interest Käte Otersdorf , a nurse who may or may not have had a romance with Richthofen in real life .
