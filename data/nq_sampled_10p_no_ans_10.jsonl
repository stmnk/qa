{"document_text": "Echo ( command ) - wikipedia <H1> Echo ( command ) </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> In computing , echo is a command in DOS , OS / 2 , Microsoft Windows , Unix and Unix - like operating systems that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments . It is a command typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file , or as a source part of a pipeline . </P> <P> Many shells , including all Bourne - like ( such as Bash or zsh , ) and Csh - like shells implement echo as a builtin command . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Usage example </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> echo began within Multics , and became part of Version 2 Unix . echo - n in Version 7 replaced prompt , ( which behaved like echo but without terminating its output with a line delimiter ) . </P> <P> On PWB / UNIX and later Unix System III , echo started expanding C escape sequences such as \\ n with the notable difference that octal escape sequences were expressed as \\ 0ooo instead of \\ ooo in C . </P> <P> Eighth Edition Unix echo only did the escape expansion when passed a - e option , and that behaviour was copied by a few other implementations such as the builtin echo command of Bash or zsh and GNU echo . </P> <P> Nowadays , several incompatible implementations of echo exist on different operating systems ( often several on the same system ) , some of them expanding escape sequences by default , some of them not , some of them accepting options ( the list of which varying with implementations ) , some of them not . </P> <P> The POSIX Specification of echo leaves the behaviour unspecified if the first argument is - n or any argument contain backslash characters while the Unix specification ( XSI option in POSIX ) mandates the expansion of ( some ) sequences and does not allow any option processing .

{"document_text": "Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials - wikipedia <H1> Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials </H1> Jump to : navigation , search See also : List of Confederate monuments and memorials and Monument and memorial controversies in the United States The Robert E. Lee monument in New Orleans being lowered , May 19 , 2017 <P> In the wake of the Charleston church shooting in June 2015 , several municipalities in the United States removed monuments and memorials dedicated to the Confederate States of America . The momentum accelerated in August 2017 after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , Virginia . The removals were driven by the belief that the monuments glorify white supremacy and memorialize a government whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of slavery . Many of those who object to the removals claim that the artifacts are part of the cultural heritage of the United States . </P> <P> The vast majority of these Confederate monuments were built during the Jim Crow Era ( 1877 - 1954 ) and the African - American Civil Rights Movement ( 1954 -- 1968 ) era as a means of intimidating African Americans and reaffirming white supremacy . The monuments have thus become highly politicized ; according to Eleanor Harvey , a senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and a scholar of Civil War history : `` If white nationalists and neo-Nazis are now claiming this as part of their heritage , they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again '' . According to Stan Deaton , senior historian at the Georgia Historical Society , `` These laws are the Old South imposing its moral and its political views on us forever more . This is what led to the Civil War , and it still divides us as a country . We have competing visions not only about the future but about the past .

These two periods also coincided with the 50th anniversary and the American Civil War Centennial . The peak in construction of Civil War Monuments occurred between the late 1890s up to 1920 , with a second , smaller peak in the late 1950s to mid 1960s . </P> <P> According to historian Jane Dailey from University of Chicago , in many cases the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a `` white supremacist future '' . Another historian , Karyn Cox , from University of North Carolina has written that the monuments are `` a legacy of the brutally racist Jim Crow era '' . Another historian from UNC , James Leloudis , stated that `` The funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the Jim Crow era and the right of white men to rule . '' </P> <P> Adam Goodheart , Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at Washington College , stated in National Geographic : `` They 're 20th - century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners , but importantly still excluded black people . '' </P> <H2> Academic commentary ( edit ) </H2> <P> In an August 2017 statement on the monuments controversy , the American Historical Association ( AHA ) said that to remove a monument `` is not to erase history , but rather to alter or call attention to a previous interpretation of history . '' The AHA noted that most monuments were erected `` without anything resembling a democratic process , '' and recommended that it was `` time to reconsider these decisions . '' According to the AHA , most Confederate monuments were erected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , and this undertaking was `` part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the South . '' According to the AHA , memorials to the Confederacy erected during this period `` were intended , in part , to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow Reconstruction , and to intimidate African Americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life . '' A later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement , and according to the AHA `` these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes . '' </P> <P> According to historian Adam Goodheart , the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise . Elijah Anderson , a professor of sociology at Yale University , said the statues `` really impacts the psyche of black people . '' Harold Holzer , the director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College , agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans . Dell Upton , chair of the Department of Art History at the University of California , Los Angeles , wrote that `` the monuments were not intended as public art , '' but rather were installed `` as affirmations that the American polity was a white polity , '' and that because of their explicitly white supremacist intent , their removal from civic spaces was a matter `` of justice , equity , and civic values . '' In a 1993 book , author Frank McKenney argued otherwise ; `` These monuments were communal efforts , public art , and social history , '' he wrote . Ex-soldiers and politicians had difficult time raising funds to erect monuments so the task mostly fell to the women , the `` mothers widows , and orphans , the bereaved fiancees and sisters '' of the soldiers who had lost their lives . Many ladies memorial associations were formed in the decades following the end of the Civil War , most of them joining the United Daughters of the Confederacy following its inception in 1894 . The women were advised to `` remember that they were buying art , not metal and stone ; '' The history the monuments celebrated told only one side of the story , however -- one that was `` openly pro-Confederate , '' Upton argues . Furthermore , Confederate monuments were erected without the consent or even input of Southern African - Americans , who remembered the Civil War far differently , and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved . According to Civil War historian Judith Giesberg , professor of history at Villanova University , `` White supremacy is really what these statues represent . '' </P> <P> Robert Seigler in his study of Confederate monuments in South Carolina found that out of the over one hundred and seventy that he documented , only five monuments were found dedicated to the African Americans who had been used by the Confederacy working `` on fortifications , and had served as musicians , teamsters , cooks , servants , and in other capacities , '' four of those were to slaves and one to a musician , Henry Brown . </P> <P> Eric Foner , a historian of the Civil War and biographer of Lincoln , argued that more statues of African - Americans like Nat Turner should be constructed . Alfred Brophy , a professor of law at the University of Alabama , argued the removal of the Confederate statues `` facilitates forgetting '' , although these statues were `` re-inscribed images of white supremacy '' . Brophy also stated that the Lee statue in Charlottesville should be removed . </P> <H2> History of removals ( edit ) </H2> Planned removal of the Robert Edward Lee Sculpture in Charlottesville , Va. sparked protests and counter-protests , resulting in three deaths . <P> The removals were marked by events in Louisiana and Virginia within the span of two years . In Louisiana , after the Charleston church shooting of 2015 , the city of New Orleans removed its Confederate memorials two years later . A few months later , in August 2017 , a state of emergency was declared in Virginia after a Unite the Right rally against the removal of the Robert Edward Lee statue in Charlottesville turned violent . </P> <P> Other events followed across the United States . In Baltimore , for example , the city 's Confederate statues were removed on the night of August 15 -- 16 , 2017 . Mayor Catherine Pugh said that she ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety . Similarly , in Lexington , Kentucky , Mayor Jim Gray asked the city council on August 16 , 2017 to approve the relocation of two statues from a courthouse . A different event occurred in Durham , North Carolina , where several protesters toppled the Confederate Soldiers Monument outside the Old Durham County Courthouse on August 15 , 2017 . Eight activists were arrested in connection with the illegal action . </P> <H2> Laws prohibiting removals ( edit ) </H2> <P> In Alabama ( 2017 ) , Mississippi ( 2004 ) , North Carolina ( 2015 ) , South Carolina ( 2000 ) , Tennessee ( 2016 ) , and Virginia ( 1902 ) , state laws prohibit the removal or alteration of monuments . Attempts to repeal these laws have not yet ( 2017 ) been successful . Alabama 's law , the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act , was passed in May 2017 , North Carolina 's law in 2015 . Tennessee passed its Tennessee Heritage Protection Act in 2016 . </P> <P> The removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol required a 2 / 3 vote of both houses of the legislature . </P> <P> A 2017 Reuters poll found that 54 % of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces , and 27 % said they should be removed , while 19 % said they were unsure . The results were split along racial and political lines , with Republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place , while Democrats and minorities preferring their removal . Another 207 poll , by HuffPost / YouGov , found that 33 % of respondents favored removal while 48 % were opposed , with roughly 18 % unsure about removal . </P> <H2> Removed monuments and memorials ( edit ) </H2> <H2> Alabama ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Birmingham <Ul> <Li> In August 2017 , immediately after William A. Bell , the mayor of Birmingham , draped a Confederate memorial with plastic and surrounded it with plywood with the rationale `` This country should in no way tolerate the hate that the KKK ( Ku Klux Klan ) , neo-Nazis , fascists and other hate groups spew '' , Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall sued Bell and the city for violating a new ( 2017 ) state law that prohibits the `` relocation , removal , alteration , or other disturbance of any monument on public property that has been in place for 40 years or more '' . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Demopolis <Ul> <Li> Confederate Park . Renamed `` Confederate Park '' in 1923 at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy . A Confederate soldier statue was erected in 1910 at the intersection of North Main Avenue and West Capital Street adjacent to the Park . It was destroyed on July 16 , 2016 , when a policeman accidentally crashed his patrol car into the monument . The statue fell from its pedestal and was heavily damaged . In 2017 , Demopolis city government voted 3 -- 2 to move the damaged Confederate statue to a local museum and to install a new obelisk memorial that honors both the Union and the Confederate soldiers . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H2> Arizona ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Fort Breckinridge : Named for John C.

( New provisions effective 2011 Jul 01 . ) </P> <H2> Carrying handguns ( edit ) </H2> <P> Indiana requires a license for most methods of carrying a handgun . Indiana laws are silent concerning the manner of carry ; therefore , the laws cover open carry , concealed carry , vehicle carry , and locked case carry . There are exceptions for carrying a handgun unloaded , not readily accessible , and secured in a case in a vehicle , on your own property , from place of purchase and to a firearm range for the purpose of practice . </P> <P> Indiana is a `` shall issue '' state for the License To Carry a Handgun . A license to carry will be issued to individuals age 18 or older who meet a number of legal requirements . Currently both limited term and unlimited lifetime licenses are available . </P> <P> Grounds for disqualification include a conviction for a felony or for misdemeanor domestic battery . A license can also be denied if the applicant has been arrested for a violent crime and `` a court has found probable cause to believe that the person committed the offense charged '' . Documented substance abuse within a certain time frame is a disqualifier , as is documented evidence of any given person 's `` propensity for violent or emotionally unstable conduct . '' </P> <P> Indiana residents , or non-residents with a `` regular place of business '' in Indiana , must obtain an Indiana license . Application for a license must be made to the local police department , or absent that , to the county police department . Four - year and lifetime permits are issued for Indiana residents . Out - of - state residents may only be issued four - year permits , minus Active Duty Military who become stationed in Indiana . Active Duty military stationed in Indiana can apply for lifetime permits through their local city or county police department . </P> <P> Indiana law stands mute vis - à - vis long gun carry . There are some Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) rules , but these only apply on DNR properties or to hunters . Generally speaking , possession of long guns is legal whether the gun is either on one 's person or in one 's motor vehicle , loaded or not , concealed or not . There are additional rules regarding firearms possession on ATVs and snowmobiles . </P> <H2> Restricted locations ( edit ) </H2> <P> It is illegal to carry a concealed weapon , even sporting arms , on school property ( K - 12 and day care ) or on a school bus , Lawful gun owners may have guns in their vehicles on school property provided the gun is stored out of plain sight in the person 's locked motor vehicle or that the driver is only transporting someone to , or from , a school event . It is also illegal to carry on a commercial airplane or in the controlled section of an airport , on a riverboat gambling cruise , at the Indiana State Fair , courthouses and the Indiana Statehouse and Government Center . Carrying on Army Corps of Engineers property which include Brookville Lake , Cagles Mill Lake , Cecil M. Harden Lake , J. Edward Roush Lake , Mississinewa Lake , Monroe Lake , Patoka Lake , and Salamonie Lake is restricted according to CFR Title 36 , Chapter 111 , Part 327 . </P> <P> Private businesses may restrict or forbid firearms on their properties . However , a 2010 law prohibits employers from discharging employees for in - vehicle firearms possession on business property . Furthermore , an employer may not ask any employee about the possession of firearms and / or ammunition . </P> <H2> Ownership and purchase ( edit ) </H2> <P> Firearms dealers or private individuals may not sell any firearm to someone less than 18 years old , or less than 23 years old if the buyer was `` adjudicated a delinquent child for an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult '' , or to a person who is mentally incompetent or is a drug or alcohol abuser . </P> <P> All NFA - regulated weapons and devices are legal in Indiana . </P> <H2> Reciprocity ( edit ) </H2> <P> Indiana honors all other states handgun licenses , though not all other states honor Indiana 's license . Because there is no obligation for one state to notify another state of any change in their gun laws the Indiana State Police does not attempt to track this information . An Illinois Firearms Owners Identification ( FOID ) card allows Illinois residents to purchase and possess firearms and ammunition . The FOID is not a permit to carry a handgun , therefore it is not honored as such by Indiana , but the Illinois license to carry a concealed firearm , first issued in February 2014 , is honored like that of any other state . </P> <P> The following states have established arrangements where they recognize or honor permits or licenses issued by the State of Indiana : Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Idaho , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , New Hampshire , North Carolina , North Dakota , Ohio , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Vermont , Wisconsin , and Wyoming . </P> <H2> Firearm ( handgun ) license Statistics ( edit ) </H2> <P> In January 2013 , the Indiana State Police Firearms Section began publishing quarterly reports that show the number of active handgun licenses held by Indiana residents . As of December 31 , 2015 , there were 661,334 active licenses to carry firearms issued by Indiana , with 23.8 % being issued to females . In 2015 , 5.4 % of all applicants were rejected for various reasons , 15.5 % of rejected applicants being female . </P> <H2> Loss of firearm rights ( edit ) </H2> <P> Both Indiana and Federal laws restrict purchase and possession under certain circumstances . Federal law prohibits possession of firearms for life by those convicted of felonies and for those convicted of misdemeanors involving domestic violence . Indiana law prohibits as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 2 - 1 prohibits carrying handguns or possession within dwelling by those convicted of domestic battery . </Li> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 4 - 6 states that it is a Class A misdemeanor for a person convicted of domestic battery to possess a firearm . </Li> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 2 - 7 prohibits transfer or sale of firearms to any person with a felony conviction . </Li> <Li> IC 35 - 47 - 4 - 5 prohibits possession of firearms for convictions of `` serious violent felonies '' . </Li> </Ul> <P> While Indiana law mirrors federal law for the most part , it does not ban those with non-violent felonies from possession of firearms . Therefore , a person with a non-violent felony in Indiana would be allowed to possess a firearm under Indiana law , but because federal law prohibits possession in this instance , that person would be unable to purchase a firearm since purchasing a firearm is subject to federal law and a NICS background check . </P> <H2> Restoration of firearm rights ( edit ) </H2> <P> Because firearm rights are governed by state and federal law , whether someone can restore those rights can be a tricky question even for an attorney to answer . In some circumstances a person might be able to restore their Indiana rights while not fully restoring their federal rights . </P> <P> For those barred from possession because of a conviction for domestic battery , Indiana Code § 35 - 47 - 4 - 7 allows one to petition the court for restoration of the right after 5 years from the date of conviction . </P> <P> Restoration of rights for those convicted of felonies is usually barred by federal law . This arises because federal law does not recognize expungements as restoring firearm rights if the expungement does not fully satisfy federal law by fully sealing the conviction so that it can not be used in subsequent proceedings . Therefore , while an Indiana expungement restores civil rights ( except for domestic battery , which requires a separate petition ) , it does not restore one 's federal rights . The only exception is for non-violent Class D felony convictions . Because Indiana law allows those with non-violent Class D felony convictions to petition the court to reduce the felony to a Class A misdemeanor , unless a person was barred by other convictions , a successful reduction will restore a person 's rights under federal and state law . </P> <H2> Other laws ( edit ) </H2> <P> Cartridges that `` can be fired in a handgun '' that have `` a projectile that has a metal core and an outer coating of plastic '' are prohibited . `` This section does not apply to nylon coated ammunition , plastic shot capsules , or ammunition designed to be used in rifles or shotguns . '' </P> <P> Indiana provides lawsuit protection to law - abiding manufacturers , sellers , and trade associations for the misuse of firearms by third parties . Lawsuits are permitted for cases of damage or injury caused by defective firearms or ammunition , or breach of contract or warranty . </P> <P> Indiana 's law about self - defense ( and the defense of others ) can be found at Indiana Code , Title 35 , Article 41 , Chapter 3 -- 2 . </P> <P> Suppressors are legal in the state of Indiana with the correct provisions and tax stamps to the correct federal entities and may be used for hunting . </P> <P> The information in this article is either directly stated ( or inferred ) from Indiana Code , Title 35 , Article 47 , Chapters 1 -- 14 , Title 34 , Article 28 , Chapter 7 and Title 34 , Article 12 , Chapter 3 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ NRA - ILA . `` NRA - ILA Indiana : 2017 Legislative Session Adjourns '' .

{"document_text": "Dog behavior - wikipedia <H1> Dog behavior </H1> A drawing by Konrad Lorenz showing facial expressions of a dog - a communication behavior <P> Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses of individuals or groups of domestic dogs to internal and external stimuli . It has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans and their lifestyles . As a result of this physical and social evolution , dogs , more than any other species , have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to their behaviors .

Whole genome sequencing indicates that the dog , the gray wolf and the extinct Taymyr wolf diverged at around the same time 27,000 - 40,000 years ago . How dogs became domesticated is not clear , however the two main hypotheses are self - domestication or human domestication . There exists evidence of human - canine coevolution . </P> <H2> Intelligence ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog intelligence <P> Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems . Dogs have been shown to learn by inference . A study with Rico showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items . He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure . Dogs have advanced memory skills . A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie , `` Chaser '' , who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words . Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing , and to understand human voice commands . After undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task , dogs that are faced with an insolvable version of the same problem look at the human , while socialized wolves do not . Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception . </P> <H2> Senses ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog anatomy § Senses <P> The dog 's senses include vision , hearing , sense of smell , taste , touch and sensitivity to the earth 's magnetic field . </P> <H2> Communication behavior ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog communication <P> Dog communication is about how dogs `` speak '' to each other , how they understand messages that humans send to them , and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit . These communication behaviors include eye gaze , facial expression , vocalization , body posture ( including movements of bodies and limbs ) and gustatory communication ( scents , pheromones and taste ) . Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization , hand signals and body posture . </P> <H2> Social behavior ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two studies have indicated that dog behavior varied with their size , body weight and skull size . </P> <H3> Play ( edit ) </H3> Dog - dog ( edit ) Dog playing with a guinea pig . <P> Play between dogs usually involves several behaviours that are often seen in aggressive encounters , for example , nipping , biting and growling . It is therefore important for the dogs to place these behaviours in the context of play , rather than aggression . Dogs signal their intent to play with a range of behaviours including a `` play - bow '' , `` face - pawed '' `` open - mouthed play face '' and postures inviting the other dog to chase the initiator . Similar signals are given throughout the play bout to maintain the context of the potentially aggressive activities . </P> <P> From a young age , dogs engage in play with one another . Dog play is made up primarily of mock fights . It is believed that this behavior , which is most common in puppies , is training for important behaviors later in life . Play between puppies is not necessarily a 50 : 50 symmetry of dominant and submissive roles between the individuals ; dogs who engage in greater rates of dominant behaviours ( e.g. chasing , forcing partners down ) at later ages also initiate play at higher rates . This could imply that winning during play becomes more important as puppies mature . </P> <P> Emotional contagion is linked to facial mimicry in humans and primates . Facial mimicry is an automatic response that occurs in less than 1 second in which one person involuntary mimics another person 's facial expressions , forming empathy . It has also been found in dogs at play , and play sessions lasted longer when there were facial mimicry signals from one dog to another . </P> Dog - human ( edit ) <P> The motivation for a dog to play with another dog is distinct from that of a dog playing with a human . Dogs walked together with opportunities to play with one another , play with their owners with the same frequency as dogs being walked alone . Dogs in households with two or more dogs play more often with their owners than dogs in households with a single dog , indicating the motivation to play with other dogs does not substitute for the motivation to play with humans . </P> <P> It is a common misconception that winning and losing games such as `` tug - of - war '' and `` rough - and - tumble '' can influence a dog 's dominance relationship with humans . Rather , the way in which dogs play indicates their temperament and relationship with their owner . Dogs that play rough - and - tumble are more amenable and show lower separation anxiety than dogs which play other types of games , and dogs playing tug - of - war and `` fetch '' are more confident . Dogs which start the majority of games are less amenable and more likely to be aggressive . </P> <P> Playing with humans can affect the cortisol levels of dogs . In one study , the cortisol responses of police dogs and border guard dogs was assessed after playing with their handlers . The cortisol concentrations of the police dogs increased , whereas the border guard dogs ' hormone levels decreased . The researchers noted that during the play sessions , police officers were disciplining their dogs , whereas the border guards were truly playing with them , i.e. this included bonding and affectionate behaviours . They commented that several studies have shown that behaviours associated with control , authority or aggression increase cortisol , whereas play and affiliative behaviour decrease cortisol levels . </P> <H3> Empathy ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2012 , a study found that dogs oriented toward their owner or a stranger more often when the person was pretending to cry than when they were talking or humming . When the stranger pretended to cry , rather than approaching their usual source of comfort , their owner , dogs sniffed , nuzzled and licked the stranger instead . The dogs ' pattern of response was behaviorally consistent with an expression of empathic concern . </P> <P> A study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when separated from others . </P> <H3> Personalities ( edit ) </H3> <P> The term personality has been applied to human research , whereas the term temperament has been mostly used for animal research . However , both terms have been used interchangeably in the literature , or purely to distinguish humans from animals and avoid anthropomorphism . Personality can be defined by `` a set of behaviours that are consistent over context and time '' . Human personality is often studied using models that look at broad dimensions of personality . For example , the Five Factor Model is one of the most commonly used models , and the most extensively studied . It is composed of five dimensions : openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism . Studies of dog personality have also tried to identify the presence of broad personality traits that are stable over time . Recently , dog 's personality dimension has been shown to be relatively consistent over time . </P> <P> There are different approaches to assess dog personality : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Ratings of individual dogs : either a caretaker or a dog expert who is familiar with the dog is asked to answer a questionnaire , for instance the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire , concerning how often the dog show certain type of behaviour . </Li> <Li> Tests : the dog is submitted to a set of tests and its reactions are evaluated on a behavioural scale . For instance , the dog is presented to a familiar and then an unfamiliar person in order to measure sociability or aggression . </Li> <Li> Observational test : The dog 's behaviour is evaluated in a selected but not controlled environment . An observer focus on the dog 's reactions to naturally occurring stimuli . For example a walk through the supermarket can allow the observer to see the dog in various types of conditions ( crowd , loud noise ... ) . </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Several potential personality traits have been identified in dogs , for instance `` Playfulness '' , `` Curiosity / Fearlessness , `` Chase - proneness '' , `` Sociability and Aggressiveness '' and `` Shyness -- Boldness '' . A meta - analysis of 51 published peer reviewed articles identified seven dimension of canine personality : </P> <Ol> <Li> Reactivity ( approach or avoidance of new objects , increased activity in novel situations ) </Li> <Li> Fearfulness ( shaking , avoiding novel situations ) </Li> <Li> Activity </Li> <Li> Sociability ( initiating friendly interactions with people and other dogs ) </Li> <Li> Responsiveness to Training ( working with people , learning quickly ) </Li> <Li> Submissiveness </Li> <Li> Aggression </Li> </Ol> <P> Dog Breed plays an important role in the dog 's personality dimensions , while the effects of age and sex have not been clearly determined . Dogs personality models can be used for a range of tasks , including guide and working dog selection , finding appropriate families to re-home shelter dogs , or selecting breeding stock . </P> <H3> Leadership , dominance and social groups ( edit ) </H3> Two dogs playing follow the leader . <P> Dominance is a descriptive term for the relationship between pairs of individuals . Among ethologists , dominance has been defined as ' ' an attribute of the pattern of repeated , antagonistic interactions between two individuals , characterized by a consistent outcome in favor of the same dyad member and a default yielding response of its opponent rather than escalation . The status of the consistent winner is dominant and that of the loser subordinate . ' ' Another definition is that a dominant animal has priority of access to resources . Dominance is a relative attribute , not absolute ; there is no reason to assume that a high - ranking individual in one group would also become high ranking if moved to another . Nor is there any good evidence that ' ' dominance ' ' is a lifelong character trait . Competitive behavior characterized by confident ( e.g. growl , inhibited bite , stand over , stare at , chase , bark at ) and submissive ( e.g. crouch , avoid , displacement lick / yawn , run away ) patterns exchanged . </P> <P> One test to ascertain in which group the dominant dog was used the following criteria : When a stranger comes to the house , which dog starts to bark first or if they start to bark together , which dog barks more or longer ? Which dog licks more often the other dog 's mouth ? If the dogs get food at the same time and at the same spot , which dog starts to eat first or eats the other dog 's food ? If the dogs start to fight , which dog usually wins ? </P> <P> Domestic dogs appear to pay little attention to relative size , despite the large weight differences between the largest and smallest individuals ; for example , size was not a predictor of the outcome of encounters between dogs meeting while being exercised by their owners nor was size correlated with neutered male dogs . Therefore , many dogs do not appear to pay much attention to the actual fighting ability of their opponent , presumably allowing differences in motivation ( how much the dog values the resource ) and perceived motivation ( what the behavior of the other dog signifies about the likelihood that it will escalate ) to play a much greater role . </P> <P> Two dogs that are contesting possession of a highly valued resource for the first time , if one is in a state of emotional arousal , in pain ; if reactivity is influenced by recent endocrine changes , or motivational states such as hunger , then the outcome of the interaction may be different than if none of these factors were present . Equally , the threshold at which aggression is shown may be influenced by a range of medical factors , or , in some cases , precipitated entirely by pathological disorders . Hence , the contextual and physiological factors present when two dogs first encounter each other may profoundly influence the long - term nature of the relationship between those dogs . The complexity of the factors involved in this type of learning means that dogs may develop different ' ' expectations ' ' about the likely response of another individual for each resource in a range of different situations . Puppies learn early not to challenge an older dog and this respect stays with them into adulthood . When adult animals meet for the first time , they have no expectations of the behavior of the other : they will both , therefore , be initially anxious and vigilant in this encounter ( characterized by the tense body posture and sudden movements typically seen when two dogs first meet ) , until they start to be able to predict the responses of the other individual . The outcome of these early adult -- adult interactions will be influenced by the specific factors present at the time of the initial encounters . As well as contextual and physiological factors , the previous experiences of each member of the dyad of other dogs will also influence their behavior . </P> <H3> Scent ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dogs have an olfactory sense 40 times more sensitive than a human 's and they commence their lives operating almost exclusively on smell and touch . The special scents that dogs use for communication are called pheromones . Different hormones are secreted when a dog is angry , fearful or confident , and some chemical signatures identify the sex and age of the dog , and if a female is in the estrus cycle , pregnant or recently given birth . Many of the pheromone chemicals can be found dissolved in a dog 's urine , and sniffing where another dog has urinated gives the dog a great deal of information about that dog . Male dogs prefer to mark vertical surfaces and having the scent higher allows the air to carry it farther . The height of the marking tells other dogs about the size of the dog , as among canines size is an important factor in dominance . </P> <P> Dogs ( and wolves ) mark their territories with urine and their stools . The anal gland of canines give a particular signature to fecal deposits and identifies the marker as well as the place where the dung is left . Dogs are very particular about these landmarks , and engage in what is to humans a meaningless and complex ritual before defecating . Most dogs start with a careful bout of sniffing of a location , perhaps to erect an exact line or boundary between their territory and another dog 's territory . This behavior may also involve a small degree of elevation , such as a rock or fallen branch , to aid scent dispersal . Scratching the ground after defecating is a visual sign pointing to the scent marking . The freshness of the scent gives visitors some idea of the current status of a piece of territory and if it is used frequently . Regions under dispute , or used by different animals at different times , may lead to marking battles with every scent marked - over by a new competitor . </P> Further information : Dog communication <H3> Feral dogs ( edit ) </H3> <P> Feral dogs are those dogs living in a wild state with no food and shelter intentionally provided by humans , and showing a continuous and strong avoidance of direct human contacts . In the developing world pet dogs are uncommon , but feral , village or community dogs are plentiful around humans . The distinction between feral , stray , and free ranging dogs is sometimes a matter of degree , and a dog may shift its status throughout its life . In some unlikely but observed cases , a feral dog that was not born wild but living with a feral group can become rehabilitated to a domestic dog with an owner . A dog can become a stray when it escapes human control , by abandonment or being born to a stray mother . A stray dog can become feral when forced out of the human environment or when co-opted or socially accepted by a nearby feral group . Feralization occurs through the development of a fear response to humans . </P> <P> Feral dogs are not reproductively self - sustaining , suffer from high rates of juvenile mortality , and depend indirectly on humans for their food , their space , and the supply of co-optable individuals . </P> <P> See further : behavior compared to other canids . </P> <H3> Other behavior ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dogs have a general behavioral trait of strongly preferring novelty ( `` neophillia '' ) compared to familiarity . The average sleep time of a dog in captivity in a 24 - hour period is 10.1 hours . </P> <H2> Reproduction behavior ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Canine reproduction <H3> Estrous cycle and mating ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although puppies do not have the urge to procreate , males sometimes engage in sexual play in the form of mounting . In some puppies , this behavior occurs as early as 3 or 4 weeks - of - age . </P> <P> Dogs reach sexual maturity and can reproduce during their first year , in contrast to wolves at two years - of - age . Female dogs have their first estrus ( `` heat '' ) at 6 to 12 months - of - age ; smaller dogs tend to come into heat earlier whereas larger dogs take longer to mature . </P> <P> Female dogs have an estrous cycle that is nonseasonal and monestrus , i.e. there is only one estrus per estrous cycle . The interval between one estrus and another is , on average , seven months , however , this may range between 4 and 12 months . This interestrous period is not influenced by the photoperiod or pregnancy . The average duration of estrus is 9 days with spontaneous ovulation usually about 3 days after the onset of estrus . </P> <P> For several days before estrus , a phase called proestrus , the female dog may show greater interest in male dogs and `` flirt '' with them ( proceptive behavior ) . There is progressive vulval swelling and some bleeding . If males try to mount a female dog during proestrus , she may avoid mating by sitting down or turning round and growling or snapping . </P> <P> Estrous behavior in the female dog is usually indicated by her standing still with the tail held up , or to the side of the perineum , when the male sniffs the vulva and attempts to mount . This tail position is sometimes called `` flagging '' . The female dog may also turn , presenting the vulva to the male . </P> <P> The male dog mounts the female and is able to achieve intromission with a non-erect penis , which contains a bone called the os penis . The dog 's penis enlarges inside the vagina , thereby preventing its withdrawal ; this is sometimes known as the `` tie '' or `` copulatory lock '' . The male dog rapidly thrust into the female for 1 -- 2 minutes then dismounts with the erect penis still inside the vagina , and turns to stand rear - end to rear - end with the female dog for up to 30 to 40 minutes ; the penis is twisted 180 degrees in a lateral plane . During this time , prostatic fluid is ejaculated . </P> <P> The female dog can bear another litter within 8 months of the previous one . Dogs are polygamous in contrast to wolves that are generally monogamous . Therefore , dogs have no pair bonding and the protection of a single mate , but rather have multiple mates in a year . The consequence is that wolves put a lot of energy into producing a few pups in contrast to dogs that maximize the production of pups . This higher pup production rate enables dogs to maintain or even increase their population with a lower pup survival rate than wolves , and allows dogs a greater capacity than wolves to grow their population after a population crash or when entering a new habitat . It is proposed that these differences are an alternative breeding strategy , one adapted to a life of scavenging instead of hunting . </P> <H3> Parenting and early life ( edit ) </H3> <P> All of the wild members of the genus Canis display complex coordinated parental behaviors . Wolf pups are cared primarily by their mother for the first 3 months of their life when she remains in the den with them while they rely on her milk for sustenance and her presence for protection . The father brings her food . Once they leave the den and can chew , the parents and pups from previous years regurgitate food for them . Wolf pups become independent by 5 to 8 months , although they often stay with their parents for years . In contrast , dog pups are cared for by the mother and rely on her for milk and protection but she gets no help from the father nor other dogs . Once pups are weaned around 10 weeks they are independent and receive no further maternal care . </P> <H2> Behavior problems ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are many different types of behavioural issues that a dog can exhibit , including growling , snapping , barking , and invading human 's space . A survey of 203 dog owners in Melbourne , Australia , found that the main behaviour problems reported by owners were overexcitement ( 63 % ) and jumping up on people ( 56 % ) . Some problems are related to attachment while others are neurological , as seen below . </P> <H3> Separation anxiety ( edit ) </H3> <P> When dogs are separated from humans , usually the owner , they often display behaviors which can be broken into the following four categories : exploratory behaviour , object play , destructive behaviour , and vocalization , and they are related to the canine 's level of arousal . These behaviours may manifest as destructiveness , fecal or urinary elimination , hypersalivation or vocalization among other things . Dogs from single - owner homes are approximately 2.5 times more likely to have separation anxiety compared to dogs from multiple - owner homes . Furthermore , sexually intact dogs are only one third as likely to have separation anxiety as neutered dogs . The sex of dogs and whether there is another pet in the home do not have an effect on separation anxiety . It has been estimated that at least 14 % of dogs examined at typical veterinary practices in the United States have shown signs of separation anxiety . Dogs that have been diagnosed with profound separation anxiety can be left alone for no more than minutes before they begin to panic and exhibit the behaviors associated with separation anxiety . Separation problems have been found to be linked to the dog 's dependency on its owner , not because of disobedience . In the absence of treatment , affected dogs are often relinquished to a humane society or shelter , abandoned , or euthanized . </P> <H3> Resource guarding ( edit ) </H3> <P> Resource guarding is exhibited by many canines , and is one of the most commonly reported behaviour issues to canine professionals . It is seen when a dog uses specific behaviour patterns so that they can control access to an item , and the patterns are flexible when people are around . If a canine places value on some resource ( i.e. food , toys , etc . ) they may attempt to guard it from other animals as well as people , which leads to behavioural problems if not treated . The guarding can show in many different ways from rapid ingestion of food to using the body to shield items . It manifests as aggressive behaviour including , but not limited to , growling , barking , or snapping . Some dogs will also resource guard their owners and can become aggressive if the behaviour is allowed to continue . Owners must learn to interpret their dog 's body language in order to try to judge the dog 's reaction , as visual signals are used ( i.e. changes in body posture , facial expression , etc . ) to communicate feeling and response . These behaviours are commonly seen in shelter animals , most likely due to insecurities caused by a poor environment . Resource guarding is a concern since it can lead to aggression , but research has found that aggression over guarding can be contained by teaching the dog to drop the item they are guarding . </P> <H3> Noise anxiety ( edit ) </H3> <P> Canines often fear , and exhibit stress responses to , loud noises . Noise - related anxieties in dogs may be triggered by fireworks , thunderstorms , gunshots , and even loud or sharp bird noises . Associated stimuli may also come to trigger the symptoms of the phobia or anxiety , such as a change in barometric pressure being associated with a thunderstorm , thus causing an anticipatory anxiety . </P> <H3> Tail chasing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Tail chasing can be classified as a stereotypy . It falls under obsessive compulsive disorder , which is a neuropsychiatric disorder that can present in dogs as canine compulsive disorder . In one clinical study on this potential behavioral problem , 18 tail - chasing terriers were given clomipramine orally at a dosage of 1 to 2 mg / kg ( 0.5 to 0.9 mg / lb ) of body weight , every 12 hours . Three of the dogs required treatment at a slightly higher dosage range to control tail chasing , however , after 1 to 12 weeks of treatment , 9 of 12 dogs were reported to have a 75 % or greater reduction in tail chasing . Personality can also play a factor in tail chasing . Dogs who chase their tails have been found to be more shy than those who do not , and some dogs also show a lower level of response during tail chasing bouts . </P> <H2> Behavior compared to other canids ( edit ) </H2> <P> Comparisons made within the wolf - like canids allow the identification of those behaviors that may have been inherited from common ancestry and those that may have been the result of domestication or other relatively recent environmental changes . Studies of free - ranging African Basenjis and New Guinea Singing Dogs indicate that their behavioral and ecological traits were the result of environmental selection pressures or selective breeding choices and not the result of artificial selection imposed by humans . </P> <H3> Early aggression ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dog pups show unrestrained fighting with their siblings from 2 weeks of age , with injury avoided only due to their undeveloped jaw muscles . This fighting gives way to play - chasing with the development of running skills at 4 -- 5 weeks . Wolf pups possess more - developed jaw muscles from 2 weeks of age , when they first show signs of play - fighting with their siblings . Serious fighting occurs during 4 -- 6 weeks of age . Compared to wolf and dog pups , golden jackal pups develop aggression at the age of 4 -- 6 weeks when play - fighting frequently escalates into uninhibited biting intended to harm . This aggression ceases by 10 -- 12 weeks when a hierarchy has formed . </P> <H3> Tameness ( edit ) </H3> <P> Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production - related traits , dogs were initially selected for their behaviors . In 2016 , a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs . These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution , and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication . These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway , with the majority of the genes affecting the fight - or - flight response ( i.e. selection for tameness ) , and emotional processing . Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves . Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds , indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation . </P> <H3> Social structure ( edit ) </H3> <P> Among canids , packs are the social units that hunt , rear young and protect a communal territory as a stable group and their members are usually related . Members of the feral dog group are usually not related . Feral dog groups are composed of a stable 2 - 6 members compared to the 2 - 15 member wolf pack whose size fluctuates with the availability of prey and reaches a maximum in winter time . The feral dog group consists of monogamous breeding pairs compared to the one breeding pair of the wolf pack . Agonistic behavior does not extend to the individual level and does not support a higher social structure compared to the ritualized agonistic behavior of the wolf pack that upholds its social structure . Feral pups have a very high mortality rate that adds little to the group size , with studies showing that adults are usually killed through accidents with humans , therefore other dogs need to be co-opted from villages to maintain stable group size . </P> <H3> Socialization ( edit ) </H3> <P> The critical period for socialization begins with walking and exploring the environment . Dog and wolf pups both develop the ability to see , hear and smell at 4 weeks of age . Dogs begin to explore the world around them at 4 weeks of age with these senses available to them , while wolves begin to explore at 2 weeks of age when they have the sense of smell but are functionally blind and deaf . The consequences of this is that more things are novel and frightening to wolf pups . The critical period for socialization closes with the avoidance of novelty , when the animal runs away from - rather than approaching and exploring - novel objects . For dogs this develops between 4 and 8 weeks of age . Wolves reach the end of the critical period after 6 weeks , after which it is not possible to socialize a wolf . </P> <P> Dog puppies require as little as 90 minutes of contact with humans during their critical period of socialization to form a social attachment . This will not create a highly social pet but a dog that will solicit human attention . Wolves require 24 hours contact a day starting before 3 weeks of age . To create a socialized wolf the pups are removed from the den at 10 days of age , kept in constant human contact until they are 4 weeks old when they begin to bite their sleeping human companions , then spend only their waking hours in the presence of humans . This socialization process continues until age 4 months , when the pups can join other captive wolves but will require daily human contact to remain socialized . Despite this intensive socialization process , a well - socialized wolf will behave differently to a well - socialized dog and will display species - typical hunting and reproductive behaviors , only closer to humans than a wild wolf . These wolves do not generalize their socialization to all humans in the same manner as a socialized dog and they remain more fearful of novelty compared to socialized dogs . </P> <P> In 1982 , a study to observe the differences between dogs and wolves raised in similar conditions took place . The dog puppies preferred larger amounts of sleep at the beginning of their lives , while the wolf puppies were much more active . The dog puppies also preferred the company of humans , rather than their canine foster mother , though the wolf puppies were the exact opposite , spending more time with their foster mother . The dogs also showed a greater interest in the food given to them and paid little attention to their surroundings , while the wolf puppies found their surroundings to be much more intriguing than their food or food bowl . The wolf puppies were observed taking part in antagonistic play at a younger age , while the dog puppies did not display dominant / submissive roles until they were much older . The wolf puppies were rarely seen as being aggressive to each other or towards the other canines . On the other hand , the dog puppies were much more aggressive to each other and other canines , often seen full - on attacking their foster mother or one another . </P> <H3> Cognition ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite claims that dogs show more human - like social cognition than wolves , several recent studies have demonstrated that if wolves are properly socialized to humans and have the opportunity to interact with humans regularly , then they too can succeed on some human - guided cognitive tasks , in some cases out - performing dogs at an individual level . Similar to dogs , wolves can also follow more complex point types made with body parts other than the human arm and hand ( e.g. elbow , knee , foot ) . Both dogs and wolves have the cognitive capacity for prosocial behavior toward humans ; however it is not guaranteed . For canids to perform well on traditional human - guided tasks ( e.g. following the human point ) both relevant lifetime experiences with humans - including socialization to humans during the critical period for social development - and opportunities to associate human body parts with certain outcomes ( such as food being provided by human hands , a human throwing or kicking a ball , etc . ) are required . </P> <P> After undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task , dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human , while socialized wolves do not . </P> <H3> Reproduction ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dogs reach sexual maturity and can reproduce during their first year in contrast to a wolf at two years . The female dog can bear another litter within 8 months of the last one . The canid genus is influenced by the photoperiod and generally reproduces in the springtime . Domestic dogs are not reliant on seasonality for reproduction in contrast to the wolf , coyote , Australian dingo and African basenji that may have only one , seasonal , estrus each year . Feral dogs are influenced by the photoperiod with around half of the breeding females mating in the springtime , which is thought to indicate an ancestral reproductive trait not overcome by domestication , as can be inferred from wolves and Cape hunting dogs . </P> <P> Domestic dogs are polygamous in contrast to wolves that are generally monogamous . Therefore , domestic dogs have no pair bonding and the protection of a single mate , but rather have multiple mates in a year . There is no paternal care in dogs as opposed to wolves where all pack members assist the mother with the pups . The consequence is that wolves put a lot of energy into producing a few pups in contrast to dogs that maximize the production of pups . This higher pup production rate enables dogs to maintain or even increase their population with a lower pup survival rate than wolves , and allows dogs a greater capacity than wolves to grow their population after a population crash or when entering a new habitat . It is proposed that these differences are an alternative breeding strategy adapted to a life of scavenging instead of hunting . In contrast to domestic dogs , feral dogs are monogamous . Domestic dogs tend to have a litter size of 10 , wolves 3 , and feral dogs 5 - 8 . Feral pups have a very high mortality rate with only 5 % surviving at the age of one year , and sometimes the pups are left unattended making them vulnerable to predators . Domestic dogs stand alone among all canids for a total lack of paternal care . </P> <P> Dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species as they generally do not regurgitate food for their young , nor the young of other dogs in the same territory . However , this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs . Regurgitating of food by the females for the young , as well as care for the young by the males , has been observed in domestic dogs , dingos and in feral or semi-feral dogs . In one study of a group of free - ranging dogs , for the first 2 weeks immediately after parturition the lactating females were observed to be more aggressive to protect the pups . The male parents were in contact with the litters as ' guard ' dogs for the first 6 -- 8 weeks of the litters ' life . In absence of the mothers , they were observed to prevent the approach of strangers by vocalizations or even by physical attacks . Moreover , one male fed the litter by regurgitation showing the existence of paternal care in some free - roaming dogs </P> <H3> Space ( edit ) </H3> <P> Space used by feral dogs is not dissimilar from most other canids in that they use defined traditional areas ( home ranges ) that tend to be defended against intruders , and have core areas where most of their activities are undertaken . Urban domestic dogs have a home range of 2 - 61 hectares in contrast to a feral dogs home range of 58 square kilometers . Wolf home ranges vary from 78 square kilometers where prey is deer to 2.5 square kilometers at higher latitudes where prey is moose and caribou . Wolves will defend their territory based on prey abundance and pack density , however feral dogs will defend their home ranges all year . Where wolf ranges and feral dog ranges overlap , the feral dogs will site their core areas closer to human settlement . </P> <H3> Predation and scavenging ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite claims in the popular press , studies could not find evidence of a single predation on cattle by feral dogs . However , domestic dogs were responsible for the death of 3 calves over one 5 - year study . Other studies in Europe and North America indicate only limited success in the consumption of wild boar , deer and other ungulates , however it could not be determined if this was predation or scavenging on carcasses . Studies have observed feral dogs conducting brief , uncoordinated chases of small game with constant barking - a technique without success . </P> <P> In 2004 , a study reviewed 5 other studies of feral dogs published between 1975 and 1995 and concluded that their pack structure is very loose and rarely involves any cooperative behavior , either in raising young or in obtaining food . Feral dogs are primarily scavengers , with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins , they are poor ungulate hunters , having little effect on wildlife populations where they are sympatric . However , several garbage dumps located within the feral dog 's home range are important for their survival . Even well - fed domestic dogs are prone to scavenge ; gastro - intestinal veterinary visits increase during warmer weather as dogs are prone to eat decaying material . Some dogs consume feces , which may contain nutrition . On occasion well - fed dogs have been known to scavenge their owners ' corpses . </P> <H2> Dogs in human Society ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Human - canine bond <P> Studies using an operant framework have indicated that humans can influence the behavior of dogs through food , petting and voice . Food and 20 -- 30 seconds of petting maintained operant responding in dogs . Some dogs will show a preference for petting once food is readily available , and dogs will remain in proximity to a person providing petting and show no satiation to that stimulus . Petting alone was sufficient to maintain the operant response of military dogs to voice commands , and responses to basic obedience commands in all dogs increased when only vocal praise was provided for correct responses . </P> <P> A study using dogs that were trained to remain motionless while unsedated and unrestrained in an MRI scanner exhibited caudate activation to a hand signal associated with reward . Further work found that the magnitude of the canine caudate response is similar to that of humans , while the between - subject variability in dogs may be less than humans . In a further study , 5 scents were presented ( self , familiar human , strange human , familiar dog , strange dog ) . While the olfactory bulb / peduncle was activated to a similar degree by all the scents , the caudate was activated maximally to the familiar human . Importantly , the scent of the familiar human was not the handler , meaning that the caudate response differentiated the scent in the absence of the person being present . The caudate activation suggested that not only did the dogs discriminate that scent from the others , they had a positive association with it . Although these signals came from two different people , the humans lived in the same household as the dog and therefore represented the dog 's primary social circle . And while dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of items that are not comparable , it seems that the `` reward response '' is reserved for their humans . </P> <P> Research has shown that there are individual differences in the interactions between dogs and their human that have significant effects on dog behavior . In 1997 , a study showed that the type of relationship between dog and master , characterized as either companionship or working relationship , significantly affected the dog 's performance on a cognitive problem - solving task . They speculate that companion dogs have a more dependent relationship with their owners , and look to them to solve problems . In contrast , working dogs are more independent . </P> <H3> Dogs in the family ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2013 , a study produced the first evidence under controlled experimental observation for a correlation between the owner 's personality and their dog 's behaviour . </P> Further information : Companion dog <H3> Dogs at work ( edit ) </H3> <P> Service dogs are those that are trained to help people with disabilities such as blindness , epilepsy , diabetes and autism . Detection dogs are trained to using their sense of smell to detect substances such as explosives , illegal drugs , wildlife scat , or blood . In science , dogs have helped humans understand about the conditioned reflex . Attack dogs , dogs that have been trained to attack on command , are employed in security , police , and military roles . Service dog programs have been established to help individuals suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) and have shown to have positive results </P> <H2> Attacks ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dog attack A dog 's teeth can inflict serious injuries <P> The human - dog relationship is based on unconditional trust , however if this trust is lost it will be difficult to reinstate . A dog 's thick fur protects it from the bite of another dog but humans are furless and are not so protected . </P> <P> In the UK between 2005 and 2013 , there were 17 fatal dog attacks . In 2007 - 08 there were 4,611 hospital admissions due to dog attacks , which increased to 5,221 in 2008 - 09 . It has been estimated that more than 200,000 people a year are bitten by dogs in England , with the annual cost to the National Health Service of treating injuries about £ 3 million . A report published in 2014 stated there were 6,743 hospital admissions specifically caused by dog bites , a 5.8 % increase from the 6,372 admissions in the previous 12 months . </P> <P> In the US between 1979 and 1996 , there were more than 300 human dog bite - related fatalities . In the US in 2013 , there were 31 dog - bite related deaths . Each year , more than 4.5 million people in the US are bitten by dogs and almost 1 in 5 require medical attention . </P> <P> Attack training is condemned by some as promoting ferocity in dogs ; a 1975 American study showed that 10 % of dogs that have bitten a person received attack dog training at some point . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Gray wolf # Behavior </Li> <Li> Alpha roll </Li> <Li> Dog communication </Li> <Li> Dog intelligence </Li> <Li> Calming signals </Li> <Li> Pack ( canine ) </Li> <Li> Pack hunter </Li> <Li> Attachment behaviour in wolves </Li> <Li> Separation anxiety disorder ( humans ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Levitis , Daniel ; William Z .

Little Ricky was played by a number of actors , including James John Ganzer , twins Richard and Ronald Lee Simmons , twins Michael and Joseph Mayer and , most notably , Keith Thibodeaux , billed as Little Ricky . Although the I Love Lucy announcer and the opening credits of The Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour gave his stage name as `` Little Ricky '' , in his post-Lucy acting career , particularly his four - year irregular stint on The Andy Griffith Show , he was billed as Richard Keith . </P> <P> In the show , Little Ricky is the son of Lucy Ricardo and Ricky Ricardo . Little Ricky lives with his parents in a New York Brownstone apartment building , which is owned and run by his godparents ; the family later moves to a large suburban house in Westport , Connecticut . </P> <H2> Fictional character biography ( edit ) </H2> <P> Lucy finds out she was expecting Little Ricky on the Season 2 episode `` Lucy is Enceinte .

His parents enroll him in a music school where he is the only drummer , where he forms a band named `` Ricky Ricardo and the Dixieland Band . '' Little Ricky experiences stage fright before his first music school recital but seems to overcome stage fright as he performs comfortably in many other episodes , such as `` The Ricardos Visit Cuba , '' where he plays the conga drum alongside his father ; `` Little Ricky 's School Pageant , '' where he plays the lead ; and `` Ragtime Band , '' where Little Ricky plays the drums alongside his mother and godparents . </P> <H2> Episode appearances ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Season and Episode Number </Th> <Th> Episode Title </Th> <Th> Actor portraying Little Ricky </Th> <Th> Little Ricky 's Involvement in Episode </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.16 </Td> <Td> `` Lucy Goes to the Hospital '' </Td> <Td> James John Ganzer </Td> <Td> There is only one scene in which Little Ricky appears , when the baby is brought to the maternity ward window for Ricky and the Mertz 's to see him for the first time . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.22 </Td> <Td> `` No Children Allowed '' </Td> <Td> Richard and Ronald Lee Simmons </Td> <Td> When Little Ricky cries throughout the night , neighbors complain and the clause in their lease `` No Children Allowed '' comes into play . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2.24 </Td> <Td> `` The Indian Show '' </Td> <Td> Richard and Ronald Lee Simmons </Td> <Td> Lucy appears as a dancer in Ricky 's `` Waters of the Minnetonka '' number with Little Ricky strapped on her back . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.5 </Td> <Td> `` Baby Pictures '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy and Ricky promise not to show off pictures of Little Ricky like other parents do . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.9 </Td> <Td> `` Too Many Crooks '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy escapes with Little Ricky when she believes a crook named Madame X is outside on her fire escape . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.14 </Td> <Td> `` Ricky Minds the Baby '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Little Ricky spends quality time with his father when Ricky has a week off of work . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3.20 </Td> <Td> `` Home Movies '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Ricky makes home movies about Little Ricky with his new movie camera and projector . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4.21 </Td> <Td> `` The Hedda Hopper Story '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Mrs. MacGillicuddy and Little Ricky arrive in California to join the Ricardos and the Mertzes . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.2 </Td> <Td> `` Lucy and John Wayne '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> After John Wayne signs his name in cement for the second time , Little Ricky is seen playing in the wet cement . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.5 </Td> <Td> `` The Great Train Robbery '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> When Mrs. MacGillicuddy and Little Ricky get moved to a different room on the train ride back to New York from California , Lucy first thinks they 've been kidnapped . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.6 </Td> <Td> `` Homecoming '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> The Ricardos , Mertzes and Little Ricky arrive back in New York . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.9 </Td> <Td> `` Nursery School '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Little Ricky gets sick after Ricky insists that Lucy enroll him in nursery school . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.13 </Td> <Td> `` Bon Voyage '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy misses the ship to Europe when she gets off to kiss Little Ricky goodbye one more time . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5.22 </Td> <Td> `` Lucy Gets Homesick in Italy '' </Td> <Td> Joseph and Michael Mayer </Td> <Td> Lucy gets homesick on Little Ricky 's birthday . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.2 </Td> <Td> `` Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky 's incessant playing causes trouble between the Ricardos and the Mertzes . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.4 </Td> <Td> `` Little Ricky gets Stage Fright '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky panics before his first music school recital . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.7 </Td> <Td> `` Deep Sea Fishing '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> The group goes fishing and there 's a bet between the men , including Little Ricky , and the women about who can catch the bigger fish . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.8 </Td> <Td> `` Desert Island '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> The group , including Little Ricky , get stranded at sea when Lucy gets only half a tank of gas for the boat . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.9 </Td> <Td> `` The Ricardos Visit Cuba '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky plays the Conga drums alongside his father in a night club performance in Cuba . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6.10 </Td> <Td> `` Little Ricky 's School Pageant '' </Td> <Td> Little Ricky </Td> <Td> Little Ricky lands the lead in his school play , `` The Enchanted Forest .

The battle took place on October 7 , 1780 , 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of the present - day town of Kings Mountain , North Carolina in what is now rural Cherokee County , South Carolina , where the Patriot militia defeated the Loyalist militia commanded by British Major Patrick Ferguson of the 71st Foot . Ignoring the participation of Ferguson , the battle has been described as `` the war 's largest all - American fight '' . </P> <P> Ferguson had arrived in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis ' main force . Ferguson issued a challenge to the rebel militias to lay down their arms or suffer the consequences . In response , the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland , James Johnston , William Campbell , John Sevier , Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson . </P> <P> Receiving intelligence on the oncoming attack , Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Lord Cornwallis ' army . However , the Patriots caught up with the Loyalists at Kings Mountain near the border with South Carolina . Achieving a complete surprise , the Patriot militiamen attacked and surrounded the Loyalists , inflicting heavy casualties . After an hour of battle , Ferguson was fatally shot while trying to break the rebel line , after which his men surrendered . Some Patriots gave no quarter until the rebel officers re-established control over their men ; they were said to be seeking revenge for alleged killings by Banastre Tarleton 's militiamen at the Battle of Waxhaws , under the slogan `` Remember Tarleton 's Quarter . '' Although victorious , the Patriots had to retreat quickly from the area for fear of Cornwallis ' advance . Later they executed nine Loyalist prisoners after a short trial . </P> <P> The battle was a pivotal moment in the Southern campaign . The surprising victory of the American patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of rebel defeats at the hands of Lord Cornwallis , and greatly raised the Patriots ' morale . With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed , Cornwallis was forced to abandon his plan to invade North Carolina and retreated into South Carolina . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Prelude to battle <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Battle of Musgrove 's Mill </Li> <Li> 1.2 Pursuit of Shelby </Li> <Li> 1.3 Muster at Sycamore Shoals </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Battle </Li> <Li> 3 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Prelude to Battle ( edit ) </H2> <P> Major Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia on May 22 , 1780 . His task was to march to the old Tryon County area , raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina Backcountry , and protect the left flank of Lord Cornwallis ' main body at Charlotte , North Carolina . </P> <H3> Battle of Musgrove 's Mill ( edit ) </H3> <P> On the morning of August 18 , 1780 two hundred mounted Patriot partisans under joint command of Colonels Isaac Shelby , James Williams , and Elijah Clarke prepared to raid a Loyalist camp at Musgrove 's Mill , which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the Enoree River . The Battle of Musgrove Mill , August 19 , 1780 occurred near a ford of the Enoree River , near the present - day border between Spartanburg , Laurens and Union Counties in South Carolina . The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists , but a local farmer informed them that the Tories had recently been reinforced by about a hundred Loyalist militia and two hundred provincial regulars on their way to join British Major Patrick Ferguson . The whole battle took perhaps an hour and within that period , sixty - three Tories were killed , an unknown number wounded , and seventy were taken prisoner . The Patriots lost only about four dead and twelve wounded . </P> <P> Some Whig leaders briefly considered attacking the Tory stronghold at Ninety Six , South Carolina ; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been defeated at Camden three days previous . </P> <H3> Pursuit of Shelby ( edit ) </H3> <P> Shelby 's forces covered sixty miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making their escape . In the wake of General Horatio Gates ' blundering defeat at Camden , the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories . </P> <P> Shelby and his Overmountain Men crossed back over the Appalachian Mountains and retreated back into the territory of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present day Elizabethton , Tennessee , and by the next month on September 25 , 1780 , Colonels Shelby , John Sevier , and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the October 7 , 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain north of present day Blacksburg , South Carolina in North Carolina . </P> <P> On September 2 , Ferguson and the militia he had already recruited marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the Appalachian Mountain hill country on what is now the Tennessee / North Carolina border . By September 10 , Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town , North Carolina and , according to Shelby issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would `` lay waste to their country with fire and sword . '' </P> <P> North Carolina Patriot militia leaders Isaac Shelby and John Sevier , from the Washington District ( now northeast Tennessee ) , met and agreed to lead their militiamen against him . </P> <H3> Muster at Sycamore Shoals ( edit ) </H3> <P> Patriot leaders also sent word to a Virginia militia leader , William Campbell , asking him to join them at Sycamore Shores. Campbell called on Benjamin Cleveland to bring his Wilkes County , North Carolina militia to the rendezvous . The detachments of Shelby , Sevier and Campbell were met by 160 North Carolina militiamen led by Charles McDowell and his brother Joseph . Campbell 's cousin , Arthur Campbell , brought 200 more Virginians . About 1,100 volunteers from southwest Virginia and today 's northeast Tennessee , known as the `` Overmountain Men '' because they had settled into the wilderness west of the Appalachian Mountains ridgeline , mustered at the rendezvous on September 25 , 1780 , at Sycamore Shoals near the modern city of Elizabethton , Tennessee . Their movement had been made possible by easing tensions with the Cherokee , thanks to diplomacy by Benjamin Cleveland 's brother - in - law , Indian agent Joseph Martin . The Overmountain Men crossed Roan Mountain the next day , and proceeded in a southerly direction for about thirteen days in anticipation of fighting the British Loyalist forces . By September 30 , they had reached Quaker Meadows , the Burke County , North Carolina home of the McDowell brothers , where they united with Benjamin Cleveland and 350 men . Now 1400 strong , the Patriots marched to South Mountain , North Carolina , The five colonels leading the Patriot force ( Shelby , Sevier , William Campbell , Joseph McDowell and Cleveland ) chose William Campbell as the nominal commander , but they agreed that all five would act in council to command their combined army . </P> Gathering of Overmountain Men at Sycamore Shoals , a black and white reproduction of Lloyd Branson 's 1915 depiction of the Patriot militias joining up <P> Meanwhile , two deserters from the Patriot militia reached Patrick Ferguson and informed him of the large body of militia advancing towards him . Waiting three days for reasons that are still unclear , Ferguson ordered a retreat to Lord Cornwallis and the British main forces in Charlotte , sending a message to Cornwallis requesting reinforcements . The request did not reach Cornwallis until one day after the battle . On October 1 , Ferguson reached North Carolina 's Broad River , where he issued another pugnacious public letter , calling the local militia to join him lest they be `` pissed upon by a set of mongrels '' ( the Overmountain Men ) . </P> <P> On October 4 , the Patriot militia reached Ferguson 's former camp at Gilbert Town , where thirty Georgia militiamen joined them , anxious for action . On October 6 , they reached Cowpens , South Carolina , ( site of the future Battle of Cowpens ) , where they received word that Ferguson was east of them , heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis . They hurried to catch him . Rebel spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1200 men . Ferguson , rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety ( just a day 's march away ) , camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements . Kings Mountain is one of many rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont , near the border between North and South Carolina . It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel , a narrow instep , and a broad rounded toe . The Loyalists camped on a ridge west of Kings Pinnacle , the highest point on Kings Mountain . </P> <P> Needing to hurry , the Patriot militia put 900 men on horseback and rode for Kings Mountain . They left immediately , marching through the night of the 6th and morning of the 7th , even though the rain never stopped . By sunrise of the 7th , they forded the Broad River , fifteen miles from Kings Mountain . By early afternoon they arrived and immediately surrounded the ridge and attacked . </P> <H2> Battle ( edit ) </H2> Kings Mountain Battle layout Don Troiani 's depiction - `` Colonel Cleveland 's War Prize Oct. 7 , 1780 '' . Col. Benjamin Cleveland returning to Wilkesboro on Patrick Ferguson 's white horse after his horse , Roebuck , and Ferguson were killed . The patriots took home drums , weapons and clothes . The other colonels awarded Cleveland with Ferguson 's white horse , which he rode home . Many consider this the greatest symbolic `` War Prize '' of the revolution and the turning point of the war . <P> The battle opened about 3 p.m. , when the 900 Patriots ( including John Crockett , father of Davy Crockett ) , approached the steep base of the western ridge . They formed eight detachments of 100 to 200 men each . Ferguson was unaware that the Patriots had caught up to him and his 1,100 men . He was the only regular British soldier in the command , composed entirely of Loyalist Carolina militia , except for the 100 or so red - uniformed Provincials ( enlisted colonials ) from New York . He had not thought it necessary to fortify his camp . </P> <P> The Patriots caught the Loyalists by surprise . Loyalist officer Alexander Chesney later wrote he did n't know the Patriots were anywhere near them until the shooting started . As the screaming Patriots charged up the hill , Captain DePeyster turned to Ferguson and said , `` These things are ominous -- these are the damned yelling boys ! '' Two parties , led by Colonels John Sevier and William Campbell , assaulted the mountains `` heel '' -- the smallest in area , but its highest point . The other detachments , led by Colonels Shelby , Williams , Lacey , Cleveland , Hambright , Winston and McDowell , attacked the main Loyalist position , surrounding the `` ball '' base beside the `` heel '' crest of the mountain . </P> <P> No one in the Patriot army held command once the fighting started . Each detachment fought independently under the previously agreed to plan to surround and destroy the Loyalists . The Patriots crept up the hill and fired from behind rocks and trees . Ferguson rallied his troops and launched a desperate bayonet - charge against Campbell and Sevier . Lacking bayonets , the Patriots ran down the hill and into the woods . Campbell soon rallied his troops , returned to the hill , and resumed firing . Ferguson ordered two more bayonet charges during the battle . This became the pattern of the battle ; the Patriots would charge up the hill , then the Tories would charge down the hill with fixed bayonets , driving the Patriots off the slopes and into the woods . Once the charge was spent and the Tories returned to their positions , the Patriots would reform in the woods , return to the base of the hill , and charge up the hill again . During one of the charges , Colonel Williams was killed , and Colonel McDowell was wounded . Firing was difficult for the Loyalists , since the Patriots constantly moved using cover and concealment to their advantage . Furthermore , the downhill angle of the hill contributed to the Loyalists overshooting their marks . </P> <P> After an hour of combat , Loyalist casualties were heavy . Ferguson rode back and forth across the hill , blowing a silver whistle he used to signal charges . Shelby , Sevier and Campbell reached the top of the hill behind the Loyalist position and attacked Ferguson 's rear . The Loyalists were driven back into their camp , where they began to surrender . Ferguson drew his sword and hacked down any small white flags that he saw popping up , but he appeared to know that the end was near . In an attempt to rally his faltering men , Ferguson shouted out `` Hurrah , brave boys , the day is ours ! '' ( sic ) He gathered a few officers together and tried to cut through the Patriot ring , but Sevier 's men fired a volley and Ferguson was shot and dragged by his horse behind the Patriot line . There he was confronted by an opposing rebel officer , who demanded a surrender from the major . Ferguson shot and killed the man with his pistol in a final act of defiance , but was immediately shot dead by multiple Patriots on the spot . When the Patriots recovered his corpse , they counted seven bullet wounds . </P> <P> Seeing their leader fall , the Loyalists began to surrender . Some Patriots did not want to take prisoners , as they were eager to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or ' Tarleton 's Quarter , ' in which Banastre Tarleton 's forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford 's Continental soldiers after the latter tried to surrender . ( At Waxhaws , Tarleton 's horse was shot , pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of surrender . ) Also , other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender . </P> <P> Loyalist Captain Abraham DePeyster , in command after Ferguson was killed , sent out an emissary with a white flag , asking for quarter . For several minutes , the Patriots rejected DePeyster 's white flag and continued firing , many of them shouting , `` Give ' em Tarleton 's Quarter ! '' and `` Give them Buford 's play ! '' A significant number of the surrendering Loyalists were killed and / or wounded including the white flag emissary . When DePeyster sent out a second white flag , a few of the rebel officers , including Campbell and Sevier , ran forward and took control by ordering their men to cease fire . They took about 800 Loyalist prisoners . </P> <H2> Aftermath ( edit ) </H2> Map spot for Blacksburg , South Carolina <P> The Battle of Kings Mountain lasted 65 minutes . The Loyalists suffered 290 killed , 163 wounded , and 668 taken prisoner . The Patriot militia suffered 28 killed and 60 wounded . The Patriots had to move out quickly for fear that Cornwallis would advance to meet them . Loyalist prisoners well enough to walk were herded to camps several miles from the battlefield . The dead were buried in shallow graves and wounded were left on the field to die . Ferguson 's corpse was later reported to have been desecrated and wrapped in oxhide before burial . Both victors and captives came near to starvation on the march due to a lack of supplies in the hastily organized Patriot army . </P> <P> On October 14 , the retreating Patriot force held drumhead courts - martial of Loyalists on various charges ( treason , desertion from Patriot militias , incitement of Indian rebellion ) . Passing through the Sunshine community in what is now Rutherford County , N.C. , the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family . Aaron Biggerstaff , a Loyalist , had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded . His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner - of - war on a British ship docked at Charleston , S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour 's Mill ( modern Lincolnton , N.C. ) , in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on one side or the other . </P> <P> While stopped on the Biggerstaff land , the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners . Some were testified against by Patriots who had previously fought alongside them and later changed sides . Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought an end to the proceedings . His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea for mercy from one of the Biggerstaff women , although accounts vary as to whether it was Martha Biggerstaff , Aaron 's wife , or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff , Benjamin 's wife . Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days , while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands . The column finally made camp at Salem , North Carolina . </P> <P> Kings Mountain was a pivotal moment in the history of the American Revolution . Coming after a series of disasters and humiliations in the Carolinas -- the fall of Charleston and capture of the American army there , the destruction of another American army at the Battle of Camden , the Waxhaws Massacre -- the surprising , decisive victory at Kings Mountain was a great boost to Patriot morale . The Tories of the Carolina back country were broken as a military force . Additionally , the destruction of Ferguson 's command and the looming threat of Patriot militia in the mountains caused Lord Cornwallis to cancel his plans to invade North Carolina ; he instead evacuated Charlotte and retreated to South Carolina . He would not return to North Carolina until early 1781 , when he was chasing Nathanael Greene after the Americans had dealt British forces another defeat at the Battle of Cowpens . </P> <P> In The Winning of the West , Theodore Roosevelt wrote of Kings Mountain , `` This brilliant victory marked the turning point of the American Revolution . '' Thomas Jefferson called it , `` The turn of the tide of success . '' President Herbert Hoover at Kings Mountain said , </P> <P> This is a place of inspiring memories . Here less than a thousand men , inspired by the urge of freedom , defeated a superior force entrenched in this strategic position . This small band of Patriots turned back a dangerous invasion well designed to separate and dismember the united Colonies . It was a little army and a little battle , but it was of mighty portent . History has done scant justice to its significance , which rightly should place it beside Lexington , Bunker Hill , Trenton and Yorktown . </P> <P> In 1931 , the Congress of the United States created the Kings Mountain National Military Park at the site of the battle . The park headquarters is in Blacksburg , South Carolina , and hosts hundreds of thousands of people each year . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> American Revolutionary War portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of American Revolutionary War battles </Li> </Ul> <H2> Footnotes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Formal Report of the Battle of King 's Mountain ; Oct 1780 ; `` A Statement of the Proceedings of the Western Army ; Letter to General Gates ; '' at Tennessee GenWeb ; text : ... reprinted by the East Tennessee Historical Society , Knoxville , Tennessee , 1967 , pp. 243 - 5 , which shows 53 ( instead of 55 ) privates wounded for total of 60 wounded ; accessed January 2017 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Dameron p. 76 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` The American revolution revisited '' .

At the time , the fortress of Upnor Castle and a barrier chain called the `` Gillingham Line '' were supposed to protect the mothballed naval ships anchored off Chatham , the main English naval base in southeastern Stuart England . </P> <P> The Dutch , under nominal command of Lieutenant - Admiral Michiel de Ruyter , over several days bombarded and then captured the town of Sheerness , sailed up the River Thames to Gravesend , then risking the perils of its treacherous shallows , sandbars and shoals , sailed up the River Medway to Chatham and Gillingham , where they engaged fortifications with cannon fire , burned three capital ships and ten lesser naval vessels , and captured and towed away two ships of the line : HMS Unity and the pride and normal flagship of the English fleet , HMS Royal Charles . </P> <P> Politically , the raid was disastrous for King Charles ' war plans and led to a quick end to the war and a favourable peace for the Dutch . It was one of the worst defeats in the Royal Navy 's history , and one of the worst suffered by the British military .

The Dutch seized this opportunity to attack the English . They had made earlier plans for such an attack in 1666 after the Four Days Battle but were prevented from carrying them out by their defeat in the St James 's Day Battle . The mastermind behind the plan was the leading Dutch politician Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt . His brother Cornelis de Witt accompanied the fleet to supervise . Peace negotiations had already been in progress at Breda since March , but Charles had been procrastinating over the signing of peace , hoping to improve his position through secret French assistance . Based on these assumptions De Witt thought it best to end the war quickly with a clear victory , thereby ensuring a more advantageous settlement for the Dutch Republic . Most Dutch flag officers had strong doubts about the feasibility of such a daring attack , fearing the treacherous shoals in the Thames estuary , but they obeyed orders nevertheless . The Dutch made use of two English pilots who had defected , one a dissenter named Robert Holland , the other a smuggler who had fled English justice . </P> <H2> The raid ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

( June 2012 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> The Dutch approach ( edit ) </H3> <P> On 17 May the squadron of the Admiralty of Rotterdam with De Ruyter sailed to the Texel to join those of Amsterdam and the Northern Quarter . Hearing that the squadron of Frisia was not yet ready because of recruiting problems ( impressment being forbidden in the Republic ) , he left for the Schooneveld off the Dutch coast to join the squadron of Zealand that , however , suffered from similar problems . De Ruyter then departed for the Thames on 4 June ( Old Style used by the English , the Dutch at the time were officially using New Style dates ) with 62 frigates or ships - of - the - line , about fifteen lighter ships and twelve fireships , when the wind turned to the east . The fleet was reorganised into three squadrons : the first was commanded by De Ruyter himself , with as Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde and Rear - Admiral Jan Jansse van Nes ; the second was commanded by Lieutenant - Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes with as Vice-Admiral Enno Doedes Star and Rear - Admiral Willem van der Zaan ; the third was commanded by Lieutenant - Admiral Baron Willem Joseph van Ghent with Lieutenant - Admiral Jan van Meppel in subcommand and as Vice-Admirals Isaac Sweers and Volckert Schram and as Rear - Admirals David Vlugh and Jan Gideonsz Verburgh . The third squadron thus effectively had a second set of commanders ; this was done to use these as flag officers of a special frigate landing force , to be formed on arrival and to be headed by Colonel and Lieutenant - Admiral Van Ghent , on the frigate Agatha . Baron Van Ghent was in fact the real commander of the expedition and had done all the operational planning , as he had been the former commander of the Dutch Marine Corps , the first in history to be specialised in amphibious operations , that now was headed by the Englishman Colonel Thomas Dolman . </P> Map showing the events <P> On 6 June a fog bank was blown away and revealed the Dutch task force , sailing into the mouth of the Thames . On 7 June Cornelis de Witt revealed his secret instructions from the States General , written on 20 May , in the presence of all commanders . There were so many objections , while De Ruyter 's only substantial contribution to the discussion was `` bevelen zijn bevelen `` ( '' orders are orders `` ) , that Cornelis , after retiring to his cabin late in the night , wrote in his daily report he did not feel at all sure that he would be obeyed . The next day it transpired however that most officers were in for a bit of adventure ; they had just given their professional opinion for the record so they could blame the politicians should the whole enterprise end in disaster . That day an attempt was made to capture a fleet of twenty English merchantmen seen higher up the Thames in the direction of London , but this failed as these fled to the west , beyond Gravesend . </P> <P> The attack caught the English unawares . No serious preparations had been made for such an eventuality , although there had been ample warning from the extensive English spy network . Most frigates were assembled in squadrons at Harwich and in Scotland , leaving the London area to be protected by only a small number of active ships , most of them prizes taken earlier in the war from the Dutch . As a further measure of economy , on 24 March the Duke of York had ordered the discharge of most of the crews of the prize vessels , leaving only three guard ships at the Medway ; in compensation the crew of one of them , the frigate Unity ( the first ship to be captured from the Dutch in 1665 , from the privateer Cornelis Evertsen the Youngest ) was raised from forty to sixty ; also the number of fireships was increased from one to three . Additionally thirty large sloops were to be prepared to row any ship to safety in case of an emergency . Sir William Coventry declared that a Dutch landing near London was very unlikely ; at most the Dutch , to bolster their morale , would launch a token attack at some medium - sized and exposed target like Harwich , which place therefore had been strongly fortified in the spring . There was no clear line of command with most responsible authorities giving hasty orders without bothering to co-ordinate them first . As a result , there was much confusion . Charles did not take matters into his own hands , deferring mostly to the opinion of others . English morale was low . Not having been paid for months or even years , most sailors and soldiers were less than enthusiastic to risk their lives . England had only a small army and the few available units were dispersed as Dutch intentions were unclear . This explains why no effective countermeasures were taken though it took the Dutch about five days to reach Chatham , slowly manoeuvring through the shoals , leaving the heavier vessels behind as a covering force . They could only advance in jumps when the tide was favourable . </P> The Battle of Chatham by Willem van der Stoop . Skokloster castle , Sweden . <P> After raising the alarm on 6 June at Chatham Dockyard , Commissioner Peter Pett seems not to have taken any further action until 9 June when , late in the afternoon , a fleet of about thirty Dutch ships was sighted in the Thames off Sheerness . At this point the Commissioner immediately sought assistance from the Admiralty , sending a pessimistic message to the Navy Board , lamenting the absence of Navy senior officials whose help and advice he believed he needed . The thirty ships were those of Van Ghent 's squadron of frigates . The Dutch fleet carried about a thousand marines and landing parties were dispatched to Canvey Island in Essex and opposite on the Kent side at Sheerness . These men had strict orders by Cornelis de Witt not to plunder , as the Dutch wanted to shame the English whose troops had sacked Terschelling during Holmes 's Bonfire in August 1666 . Nevertheless , the crew of Captain Jan van Brakel could not control themselves . They were driven off by English militia , and found themselves under threat of severe punishment upon returning to the Dutch fleet . Van Brakel offered to lead the attack the next day to avoid the penalty . </P> <P> The King ordered the Earl of Oxford on 8 June to mobilise the militia of all counties around London ; also all available barges should be used to lay a ship 's bridge across the Lower Thames , so that the English cavalry could quickly switch positions from one bank to the other . Sir Edward Spragge , the famous Vice-Admiral , learned on 9 June that a Dutch raiding party had come ashore on the Isle of Grain ( a peninsula where the river Medway in Kent , meets the River Thames ) . Musketeers from the Sheerness garrison opposite were sent to investigate . </P> <P> Only in the afternoon of 10 June did the King instruct Admiral George Monck , Duke of Albemarle to go to Chatham to take charge of matters , a full three days later ordering Admiral Prince Rupert to organise the defences at Woolwich . Albemarle went first to Gravesend where he noted to his dismay that there and at Tilbury only a few guns were present , too few to halt a possible Dutch advance upon the Thames . To prevent such a disaster , he ordered all available artillery from the capital to be positioned at Gravesend . On 11 June ( Old Style ) he went to Chatham , expecting the place to be well prepared for an attack . Two members of the Navy Board , Sir John Mennes and Lord Henry Brouncker , had already travelled there on the same day . When Albemarle arrived , however , he found only twelve of the eight hundred dockyard men expected and these in a state of panic ; of the thirty sloops only ten were present , the other twenty having been used to evacuate the personal possessions of several officials , such as Pett 's ship models . No munitions or powder were available and the six - inch thick iron chain that blocked the Medway had not yet been protected by batteries . This chain system had been built during the English Civil War to repel a possible attack by the Royalist fleet , replacing earlier versions , the first dating back to 1585 . Albemarle immediately ordered the artillery to be moved from Gravesend to Chatham , which would take a day . </P> <H3> The attack ( edit ) </H3> A picture by Willem Schellincks of the raid . The view is from the south . On the left Upnor Castle is silhouetted against the flames ; on the opposite side of the river more to the front the burning dockyard of Chatham . To the north the conflagration near the chain is shown and on the horizon the ruins of Sheerness Fort are still smoking <P> The Dutch fleet arrived at the Isle of Sheppey on 10 June , and launched an attack on the incomplete Garrison Point Fort . Captain Jan van Brakel in Vrede , ( `` Peace '' ) followed by two other men - of - war , sailed as close to the fort as possible to engage it with cannon fire . Sir Edward Spragge was in command of the ships at anchor in the Medway and those off Sheerness , but the only ship able to defend against the Dutch was the frigate Unity , which was stationed off the fort . </P> <P> The Unity was supported by a number of ketches and fireships at Garrison Point , and by the fort , where sixteen guns had been hastily placed . The Unity fired one broadside , but then , when attacked by a Dutch fireship , she withdrew up the Medway , followed by the English fireships and ketches . The Dutch fired on the fort ; two men were hit . It then transpired that no surgeon was available and most of the soldiers of the Scottish garrison now deserted . Seven remained , but their position became untenable when some 800 Dutch marines landed about a mile away . With Sheerness thus lost , its guns being captured by the Dutch and the building blown up , Spragge sailed up river for Chatham on his yacht the Henrietta . Many officers were now assembled there : Spragge himself , the next day also Monck and several men of the admiralty board . All gave orders countermanding those of the others so that utter confusion reigned . </P> <P> As his artillery would not arrive soon , Monck on the 11th ordered a squadron of cavalry and a company of soldiers to reinforce Upnor Castle . River defences were hastily improvised with blockships sunk , and the chain across the river was guarded by light batteries . Pett proposed that several big and smaller ships be sunk to block the Musselbank channel in front of the chain . This way the large Golden Phoenix and the House of Sweden ( the former VOC -- ships Gulden Phenix and Huis van Swieten ) and the Welcome and the Leicester were lost and the smaller Constant John , Unicorn and John and Sarah ; when this was shown by Spragge to be insufficient , personally sounding the depth of a second channel despite the assurances by Pett , they were joined by the Barbados Merchant , Dolphin , Edward and Eve , Hind and Fortune . To do this the men first intended for the warships to be protected were used , so the most valuable ships were basically without crews . These blockships were placed in a rather easterly position , on the line Upchurch -- Stoke , and could not be covered by fire . Monck then decided also to sink blockships in Upnor Reach near Upnor Castle , presenting another barrier to the Dutch should they break through the chain at Gillingham . The defensive chain placed across the river had at its lowest point been lying practically nine feet ( about three metres ) under the water between its stages , owing to its weight , so it was still possible for light ships to pass it . Attempts were made to raise it by placing stages under it closer to the shore . </P> <P> The positions of the Charles V and the Matthias ( former Dutch merchantmen Carolus Quintus and Geldersche Ruyter ) , just above the chain were adjusted to enable them to bring their broadsides to bear upon it . The Monmouth was also moored above the chain , positioned so that she could bring her guns to bear on the space between the Charles V and the Matthias . The frigate Marmaduke and the Norway Merchant were sunk above the chain ; the large Sancta Maria ( former VOC - ship Slot van Honingen of 70 cannon ) foundered while being moved for the same purpose . Pett also informed Monck that the Royal Charles had to be moved upriver . He had been ordered by the Duke of York on 27 March to do this , but as yet had not complied . Monck at first refused to make available some of his small number of sloops , as they were needed to move supplies ; when he at last found the captain of the Matthias willing to assist , Pett answered that it was too late as he was busy sinking the blockships and there was no pilot to be found daring to take such a risk anyway . Meanwhile , the first Dutch frigates to arrive had already begun to move the Edward and Eve away , clearing a channel by nightfall . </P> `` Burning English ships '' by Jan van Leyden . Shown are the events near Gillingham : in the middle the Royal Charles is taken ; on the right Pro Patria and Schiedam set Matthias and Charles V alight <P> Van Ghent 's squadron now advanced up the Medway on 12 June , attacking the English defences at the chain . First Unity was taken by Van Brakel by assault . Then the fireship Pro Patria under commander Jan Daniëlsz van Rijn broke through the chain ( or sailed over it according to some historians , distrusting the more spectacular traditional version of events ) , the stages of which were soon after destroyed by Dutch engineers commanded by Rear - Admiral David Vlugh . She then destroyed the Matthias by fire . The fireships Catharina and Schiedam attacked the Charles V ; the Catharina under commander Hendrik Hendriksz was sunk by the shore batteries but the Schiedam under commander Gerrit Andriesz Mak set the Charles V alight ; the crew was captured by Van Brakel . The Royal Charles , with only thirty cannon aboard and abandoned by her skeleton crew when they saw the Matthias burn , was then captured by the Irishman Thomas Tobiasz , the flag captain of Vice-Admiral Johan de Liefde , and carried off to the Netherlands despite an unfavourable tide . This was made possible by lowering her draught by bringing her into a slight tilt . The jack was struck while a trumpeter played `` Joan 's placket is torn '' . Only the Monmouth escaped . Seeing the disaster Monck ordered all sixteen remaining warships further up to be sunk to prevent them from being captured , making for a total of about thirty ships deliberately sunk by the English themselves . As Andrew Marvell satirised : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Of all our navy none should now survive , </Dd> <Dd> But that the ships themselves were taught to dive </Dd> </Dl> <P> On 13 June , the whole of the Thames side as far up as London was in a panic -- some spread the rumour that the Dutch were in the process of transporting a French army from Dunkirk for a full - scale invasion -- and many wealthy citizens fled the city , taking their most valuable possessions with them . The Dutch continued their advance into the Chatham docks with the fireships Delft , Rotterdam , Draak , Wapen van Londen , Gouden Appel and Princess , under English fire from Upnor Castle and from three shore batteries . A number of Dutch frigates suppressed the English fire , themselves suffering about forty casualties in dead and wounded . Three of the finest and heaviest vessels in the navy , already sunk to prevent capture , now perished by fire : first the Loyal London , set alight by the Rotterdam under commander Cornelis Jacobsz van der Hoeven ; then the Royal James and finally the Royal Oak , that withstood attempts by two fireships but was burnt by a third . The English crews abandoned their half - flooded ships , mostly without a fight , a notable exception being army Captain Archibald Douglas , of the Scots Foot , who personally refused to abandon the Oak and perished in the flames . The Monmouth again escaped . The raid thus cost the English four of their remaining eight ships with more than 75 cannon . Three of the four largest `` big ships '' of the navy were lost . The remaining `` big ship '' , the Royal Sovereign ( the former Sovereign of the Seas rebuilt as a two - decker ) , was preserved due to her being at Portsmouth at the time . De Ruyter now joined Van Ghent 's squadron in person . </P> <H2> Account by Samuel Pepys ( edit ) </H2> Portrait of Samuel Pepys by J. Hayls <P> The diary of Samuel Pepys , as secretary of the Navy Board , is very often cited in descriptions of the raid , as it gives us direct information about the attitude of the policy makers in this period and of the psychological impact of the attack . </P> <P> Pepys at first seems to accept the consensus that the Dutch would not dare to launch an expedition against the London area ; still on 18 April he writes : `` ( ... ) then to the office , where the news is strong that not only the Dutch can not set out a fleete this year , but that the French will not , and that he ( Louis XIV ) hath given the answer to the Dutch Embassador , saying that he is for the King of England 's having an honourable peace , which , if true , is the best news we have had a good while . '' At that moment De Ruyter had already been on De Zeven Provinciën for a week . Nevertheless , he is aware of the preparations at Chatham , writing on 23 March : `` At the office all the morning , where Sir W. Pen ( sic ) come , being returned from Chatham , from considering the means of fortifying the river Medway , by a chain at the stakes , and ships laid there with guns to keep the enemy from coming up to burn our ships ; all our care now being to fortify ourselves against their invading us . '' Also he is the next day present at the meeting where the details are given : `` All their care they now take is to fortify themselves , and are not ashamed of it : for when by and by my Lord Arlington come in with letters , and seeing the King and Duke of York give us and the officers of the Ordnance directions in this matter , he did move that we might do it as privately as we could , that it might not come into the Dutch Gazette presently , as the King 's and Duke of York 's going down the other day to Sheerenesse was , the week after , in the Harlem Gazette . The King and Duke of York both laughed at it , and made no matter , but said , ' Let us be safe , and let them talk , for there is nothing will trouble them more , nor will prevent their coming more , than to hear that we are fortifying ourselves ' . '' </P> <P> Only on 3 June does Pepys become aware that the Dutch are out in force : `` the Dutch are known to be abroad with eighty sail of ships of war , and twenty fire - ships ; and the French come into the Channell with twenty sail of men - of - war , and five fireships , while we have not a ship at sea to do them any hurt with ; but are calling in all we can , while our Embassadors are treating at Bredah ; and the Dutch look upon them as come to beg peace , and use them accordingly ; and all this through the negligence of our Prince , who hath power , if he would , to master all these with the money and men that he hath had the command of , and may now have , if he would mind his business . '' </P> <P> Not until 10 June does Pepys understand that the Thames is the target : `` News brought us that , the Dutch are come up as high as the Nore ; and more pressing orders for fireships . '' The next day a growing sense of panic becomes apparent : `` Up , and more letters still from Sir W. Coventry about more fire - ships , and so Sir W. Batten and I to the office , where Bruncker come to us , who is just now going to Chatham upon a desire of Commissioner Pett 's , who is in a very fearful stink for fear of the Dutch , and desires help for God and the King and kingdom 's sake . So Bruncker goes down , and Sir J. Minnes also , from Gravesend . This morning Pett writes us word that Sheernesse is lost last night , after two or three hours ' dispute . The enemy hath possessed himself of that place ; which is very sad , and puts us into great fears of Chatham . '' In the morning of the 12th he is reassured by the measures taken by Monck : `` ( ... ) met Sir W. Coventry 's boy ; and there in his letter find that the Dutch had made no motion since their taking Sheernesse ; and the Duke of Albemarle writes that all is safe as to the great ships against any assault , the boom and chaine being so fortified ; which put my heart into great joy . '' Soon , however , this confidence is shattered : `` ( ... ) his clerk , Powell , do tell me that ill newes is come to Court of the Dutch breaking the Chaine at Chatham ; which struck me to the heart . And to White Hall to hear the truth of it ; and there , going up the back - stairs , I did hear some lacquies speaking of sad newes come to Court , saying , that hardly anybody in the Court but do look as if he cried ( ... ) . '' </P> <P> Pepys immediately draws the conclusion that this will mean the end of Charles 's regime and that a revolution is inevitable : `` All our hearts do now ake ; for the newes is true , that the Dutch have broke the chaine and burned our ships , and particularly `` The Royal Charles '' , other particulars I know not , but most sad to be sure . And , the truth is , I do fear so much that the whole kingdom is undone , that I do this night resolve to study with my father and wife what to do with the little that I have in money by me ( ... ) . </P> <P> On the 13th , the countermeasures proposed only increase his fears and make him decide to take his family and capital to safety : `` No sooner up but hear the sad newes confirmed of the Royall Charles being taken by them , and now in fitting by them -- which Pett should have carried up higher by our several orders , and deserves , therefore , to be hanged for not doing it -- and turning several others ; and that another fleete is come up into the Hope . Upon which newes the King and Duke of York have been below ( London Bridge ) since four o'clock in the morning , to command the sinking of ships at Barking - Creeke , and other places , to stop their coming up higher : which put me into such a fear , that I presently resolved of my father 's and wife 's going into the country ; and , at two hours ' warning , they did go by the coach this day , with about £ 1300 in gold in their night - bag . '' The entire city is in a state of panic : `` ( ... ) never were people so dejected as they are in the City all over at this day ; and do talk most loudly , even treason ; as , that we are bought and sold -- that we are betrayed by the Papists , and others , about the King ; cry out that the office of the Ordnance hath been so backward as no powder to have been at Chatham nor Upnor Castle till such a time , and the carriages all broken ; that Legg is a Papist ; that Upnor , the old good castle built by Queen Elizabeth , should be lately slighted ; that the ships at Chatham should not be carried up higher . They look upon us as lost , and remove their families and rich goods in the City ; and do think verily that the French , being come down with his army to Dunkirke , it is to invade us , and that we shall be invaded . '' Then even worse news is brought : `` Late at night comes Mr. Hudson , the cooper , my neighbour , and tells me that he come from Chatham this evening at five o'clock , and saw this afternoon `` The Royal James , '' `` Oake , '' and `` London , '' burnt by the enemy with their fire - ships : that two or three men - of - war come up with them , and made no more of Upnor Castle 's shooting , than of a fly ( ... ) . '' </P> <P> On the 14th more details become known of the events the previous day , showing the morale of the sailors : `` ( he ) did hear many Englishmen aboard the Dutch ships speaking to one another in English , and that they did cry and say : We did heretofore fight for tickets ; now we fight for dollars ! and did ask how such and such a one did , and would commend themselves to them : which is a sad consideration '' , and the mood of the people towards Charles `` they did in open streets yesterday at Westminster , cry , ' A Parliament ! a Parliament ! ' ; and I do believe it will cost blood to answer for these miscarriages . '' </P> <H2> The Dutch withdraw ( edit ) </H2> A copy of the Sea Triumph depicting Cornelis de Witt <P> As he expected a stiffening English resistance , Cornelis de Witt on 14 June decided to forego a further penetration and withdraw , towing the Royal Charles along as a war trophy ; the Unity also was removed with a prize crew . This decision saved the sunken - off capital ships the Royal Katherine , the Unicorn , the Victory and the St George . However , Dutch demolition teams that day rowed on boats to any ship they could reach to burn her down as much as they could , thus ensuring their reward money . One boat even re-entered the docks to make sure nothing was left above the waterline of the Oak , the James and the London ; another , by accident or malicious intent , burnt the Slot van Honingen , though it had been intended to salvage this precious merchantman . Also Chatham Dockyard escaped a destruction which might have prevented the rebuilding of the English navy for decades . Now the English villages were plundered -- by their own troops . The Dutch fleet , after celebrating by collectively thanking God for `` a great victory in a just war in self - defence '' tried to repeat its success by attacking several other ports on the English east coast but was repelled each time . On 27 June an attempt to enter the Thames beyond Gravesend was called off when it became known that the river was blocked by blockships and five fireships awaited the Dutch attack . On 2 July a Dutch marine force landed near Woodbridge north of Harwich and successfully prevented Landguard Fort from being reinforced but a direct assault on the fort by 1500 marines was beaten off by the garrison . On 3 July an attack on Osley Bay failed . On 21 July Julian calendar peace was signed . </P> <P> But still , Samuel Pepys notes in his diary on 19 July 1667 : `` The Dutch fleete are in great squadrons everywhere still about Harwich , and were lately at Portsmouth ; and the last letters say at Plymouth , and now gone to Dartmouth to destroy our Streights ' fleete lately got in thither ; but God knows whether they can do it any hurt , or no , but it was pretty news come the other day so fast , of the Dutch fleets being in so many places , that Sir W. Batten at table cried , By God , says he , I think the Devil shits Dutchmen . '' </P> <P> And on 29 July 1667 : `` Thus in all things , in wisdom , courage , force , knowledge of our own streams , and success , the Dutch have the best of us , and do end the war with victory on their side '' . </P> <H2> Aftermath ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wharf official John Norman estimated the damage caused by the raid at about £ 20,000 , apart from the replacement costs of the four lost capital ships ; the total loss of the Royal Navy must have been close to £ 200,000 . Pett was made a scapegoat , bailed at £ 5,000 and deprived of his office while those who had ignored his earlier warnings quietly escaped any blame . The Royal James , Oak and Loyal London were in the end salvaged and rebuilt , but at great cost and when the City of London refused to share in it , Charles had the name of the latter ship changed to a simple London . For a few years the English fleet was handicapped by its losses during the raid , but by around 1670 a new building programme had restored the English Navy to its former power . </P> Royal Charles stern piece at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam <P> The Raid on the Medway was a serious blow to the reputation of the English crown . Charles felt personally offended by the fact the Dutch had attacked while he had laid up his fleet and peace negotiations were in progress , conveniently forgetting he himself had not negotiated in good faith . His resentment was one of the causes of the Third Anglo - Dutch War as it made him enter into the secret Treaty of Dover with Louis XIV of France . In the 19th century , nationalistic British writers expanded on this theme by suggesting it had been the Dutch who had sued for peace after their defeats in 1666 -- although in fact these had made them , if anything , more belligerent -- and that only by treacherously attacking the English had they nevertheless been able to gain a victory ; a typical example of this is When London burned , written by the novelist G.A. Henty in 1895 . In the short term , the Lord Chancellor , Edward Hyde , 1st Earl of Clarendon was made the scapegoat , impeached and forced into exile . </P> <P> Total losses for the Dutch were eight spent fireships and about fifty casualties . In the Republic the populace was jubilant after the victory ; many festivities were held , repeated when the fleet returned in October , the various admirals being hailed as heroes . They were rewarded by a flood of eulogies and given honorary golden chains and pensions by the States General and the lesser States of the Provinces ; De Ruyter , Cornelis de Witt and Van Ghent were honoured by precious enamelled golden chalices made by Nicolaes Lockeman , depicting the events . Cornelis de Witt had a large `` Sea Triumph '' painted , with himself as the main subject , which was displayed in the townhall of Dordt . This triumphalism by De Witt 's States faction caused resentment with the rivalling Orangist faction ; when the States regime lost its power during the rampjaar of 1672 , Cornelis 's head was to be ceremoniously carved out from the painting , after Charles had for some years insisted the picture would be removed . </P> <P> The Royal Charles , her draught too deep to be of use in the shallow Dutch waters , was permanently drydocked near Hellevoetsluis as a tourist attraction , with day trips being organised for large parties , often of foreign state guests . After vehement protests by Charles that this insulted his honour , the official visits were ended and the Royal Charles was eventually scrapped in 1672 ; however , part of her transom , bearing the coat of arms with the Lion and Unicorn and the Royal inscription Dieu et mon droit , was preserved because Charles earlier had demanded its removal and it has since 1883 been put on display in the cellar of the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam . </P> <P> On 14 March 2012 the transom was transported to England on board the Royal Netherlands Navy patrol ship Holland , accompanied by the Dutch crown prince Willem - Alexander , where it was put on display , in commodate , at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich as part of the Royal River : Power , Pageantry and the Thames exhibition held on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II . </P> <H2> Rudyard Kipling ( edit ) </H2> <P> Almost 250 years later , Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem `` The Dutch in the Medway ( 1664 - 72 ) '' about these events ( giving a not altogether historically correct account ) for C.R.L. Fletcher 's A History of England ( 1911 ) : </P> <Dl> <Dd> If wars were won by feasting , </Dd> <Dd> Or victory by song , </Dd> <Dd> Or safety found , by sleeping sound </Dd> <Dd> How England would be strong ! </Dd> <Dd> But honour and dominion </Dd> <Dd> Are not maintained so , </Dd> <Dd> They 're only got by sword and shot </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> The moneys that should feed us </Dd> <Dd> You spend on your delight , </Dd> <Dd> How can you then , have sailor - men </Dd> <Dd> To aid you in your fight ? </Dd> <Dd> Our fish and cheese are rotten , </Dd> <Dd> Which makes the scurvy grow -- </Dd> <Dd> We can not serve you if we starve , : </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> Our ships in every harbour </Dd> <Dd> Be neither whole nor sound , </Dd> <Dd> And when we seek to mend a leak , </Dd> <Dd> No oakum can be found , </Dd> <Dd> Or , if it is , the caulkers , </Dd> <Dd> And carpenters also , </Dd> <Dd> For lack of pay have gone away , </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> Mere powder , guns and bullets , </Dd> <Dd> we scarce can get at all ; </Dd> <Dd> Their price was spent in merriment </Dd> <Dd> And revel at Whitehall , </Dd> <Dd> While we in tattered doublets </Dd> <Dd> From ship to ship must row , </Dd> <Dd> Beseeching friends for odds and ends -- </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> No King will heed our warnings , </Dd> <Dd> No Court will pay our claims -- </Dd> <Dd> Our King and Court for their disport </Dd> <Dd> Do sell the very Thames ! </Dd> <Dd> For , now De Ruyter 's topsails </Dd> <Dd> Off naked Chatham show , </Dd> <Dd> We dare not meet him with our fleet -- </Dd> <Dd> And this the Dutchmen know ! </Dd> </Dl> <H2> 1941 `` replay '' ( edit ) </H2> <P> On 14 December 1941 a Dutch minelayer named after Jan van Brakel , which was serving as a convoy escort on the UK eastern coast , accidentally hit the anchor buoy of one of the gate vessels which were protecting the entrance to the Medway during World War II . The commander reported this incident to the port authorities , signalling : `` Van Brakel damaged boom defence Medway '' . The instant reply was : `` What , again ?

Her mother was of Lithuanian Jewish and French Quebec ancestry , and her father was a Jewish emigrant from Odessa , Russia . The family resided at 75 Orange Street . As a small child , Foray first wanted to be a dancer , so her mother sent her to a local classes , but she had to drop out due to a case of pneumonia . Her voice was first broadcast in a local radio drama when she was 12 years old ; by age 15 , she was doing regular radio voice work . </P> <P> Two years later , after graduating from Classical High School , she moved with her parents and siblings to Los Angeles , near Ida 's brother , after Morris Forer , an engineer , fell on hard financial times . </P> <H2> Acting career ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

( August 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> After entering radio through the WBZA Players , Foray starred in her own radio series Lady Make Believe in the late 1930s . She soon became a popular voice actress , with regular appearances on coast - to - coast network shows including Lux Radio Theatre and The Jimmy Durante Show . </P> <P> In the 1940s , Foray also began film work , including a few roles in live action movies , but mostly doing voice overs for animated cartoons and radio programs and occasionally dubbing films and television . On radio , Foray did the voices of Midnight the Cat and Old Grandie the Piano on The Buster Brown Program , which starred Smilin ' Ed McConnell , from 1944 to 1952 . She later did voices on the Mutual Broadcasting System program Smile Time for Steve Allen . Her work in radio ultimately led her to recording for a number of children 's albums for Capitol Records . </P> <P> For Walt Disney , Foray voiced Lucifer the Cat in the feature film Cinderella , Lambert 's mother in Lambert the Sheepish Lion , a mermaid in Peter Pan and Witch Hazel in the Donald Duck short Trick or Treat . Decades later , Foray would be the voice of Grandmother Fa in the 1998 animated Disney film Mulan . She also did a variety of voices in Walter Lantz 's Woody Woodpecker cartoons , including Woody 's nephew and niece , Knothead and Splinter . Impressed by her performance as Witch Hazel , in 1954 Chuck Jones invited her over to Warner Brothers Cartoons . For Warner Brothers , she was Granny ( whom she has played on vinyl records starting in 1950 , before officially voicing her in Red Riding Hoodwinked , released in 1955 , taking over for Bea Benaderet ) , owner of Tweety and Sylvester , and a series of witches , including Looney Tunes ' own Witch Hazel , with Jones as director . Like most of Warner Brothers ' voice actors at the time ( with the exception of Mel Blanc ) , Foray was not credited for her roles in these cartoons . </P> <P> She played Bubbles on The Super 6 and Cindy Lou Who , asking `` Santa '' why he 's taking their tree , in How the Grinch Stole Christmas . In 1960 , she provided the speech for Mattel 's original `` Chatty Cathy '' doll ; capitalizing on this , Foray also voiced the malevolent `` Talky Tina '' doll in the Twilight Zone episode `` Living Doll '' , first aired on November 1 , 1963 . </P> June Foray , 1978 <P> Foray worked for Hanna - Barbera , including on Tom and Jerry , Scooby - Doo , Where Are You ! , The Jetsons , The Flintstones and many other shows . In 1959 , she auditioned for the part of Betty Rubble on The Flintstones , but the part went to Bea Benaderet ; Foray described herself as `` terribly disappointed '' at not getting to play Betty . </P> <P> She did extensive voice acting for Stan Freberg 's commercials , albums , and 1957 radio series , memorably as secretary to the werewolf advertising executive . She also appeared in several Rankin / Bass TV specials in the 1960s and 1970s , voicing the young Karen and the teacher in the TV special Frosty the Snowman ( although only her Karen singing parts remained in later airings , after Rankin - Bass re-edited the special a few years after it debuted , with Foray 's dialogue re-dubbed by an actress who was uncredited ) . She also voiced all the female roles in Rikki - Tikki - Tavi ( 1975 ) , including the villainous cobra Nagaina . She played multiple characters on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show , including Natasha Fatale and Nell Fenwick , as well as male lead character Rocket J. Squirrel ( a.k.a. Rocky Squirrel ) for Jay Ward , and played Ursula on George of the Jungle ; and also starred on Fractured Flickers . </P> <P> In the mid-1960s , she became devoted to the preservation and promotion of animation and wrote numerous magazine articles about animation . She and a number of other animation artists had informal meetings around Hollywood in the 1960s , and later decided to formalize this as ASIFA - Hollywood , a chapter of the Association Internationale du Film d'Animation ( the International Animated Film Association ) . She is credited with coming up with the idea of the Annie Awards in 1972 , awarded by ASIFA - Hollywood , having noted that there had been no awards to celebrate the field of animation . In 1988 , she was awarded the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award . In 1995 , ASIFA - Hollywood established the June Foray Award , which is awarded to `` individuals who have made a significant and benevolent or charitable impact on the art and industry of animation '' . Foray was the first recipient of the award . In 2007 , Foray became a contributor to ASIFA - Hollywood 's Animation Archive Project . She also had sat on the Governors ' board for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences and lobbied for two decades for the Academy to establish an Academy Award for animation ; the Academy created the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2001 from her petitioning . </P> <P> In 2007 , Britt Irvin became the first person ever to voice a character in a cartoon remake that had been previously played by Foray in the original series when she voiced Ursula in the new George of the Jungle series on Cartoon Network . In 2011 , Roz Ryan voiced Witch Lezah ( Hazel spelled backwards ) in The Looney Tunes Show , opposite June Foray as Granny . </P> <P> Foray also voiced May Parker in Spider - Man and His Amazing Friends from 1981 - 1983 , as well as Raggedy Ann on several TV movies , Grandma Howard on Teen Wolf , Jokey Smurf and Mother Nature on The Smurfs , and Magica De Spell and Ma Beagle in DuckTales .

The attack , also known as the Battle of Pearl Harbor , led to the United States ' entry into World War II . The Japanese military leadership referred to the attack as the Hawaii Operation and Operation AI , and as Operation Z during its planning . </P> <P> Japan intended the attack as a preventive action to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions they planned in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States . Over the next seven hours there were coordinated Japanese attacks on the U.S. - held Philippines , Guam and Wake Island and on the British Empire in Malaya , Singapore , and Hong Kong . </P> <P> The attack commenced at 7 : 48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 18 : 18 UTC ) . The base was attacked by 353 Imperial Japanese aircraft ( including fighters , level and dive bombers , and torpedo bombers ) in two waves , launched from six aircraft carriers . All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged , with four sunk . All but the USS Arizona were later raised , and six were returned to service and went on to fight in the war . The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship , and one minelayer. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed ; 2,403 Americans were killed and 1,178 others were wounded . Important base installations such as the power station , dry dock , shipyard , maintenance , and fuel and torpedo storage facilities , as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building ( also home of the intelligence section ) , were not attacked . Japanese losses were light : 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost , and 64 servicemen killed . One Japanese sailor , Kazuo Sakamaki , was captured . </P> <P> The surprise attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters . The following day , December 8 , the United States declared war on Japan , and several days later , on December 11 , Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. The U.S. responded with a declaration of war against Germany and Italy . Domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been fading since the Fall of France in 1940 , disappeared . </P> <P> There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan , but the lack of any formal warning , particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing , led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7 , 1941 , `` a date which will live in infamy '' . Because the attack happened without a declaration of war and without explicit warning , the attack on Pearl Harbor was later judged in the Tokyo Trials to be a war crime . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background to conflict <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Diplomatic background </Li> <Li> 1.2 Military planning </Li> <Li> 1.3 Objectives </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Approach and attack <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Submarines </Li> <Li> 2.2 Japanese declaration of war </Li> <Li> 2.3 First wave composition </Li> <Li> 2.4 Second wave composition </Li> <Li> 2.5 American casualties and damage </Li> <Li> 2.6 Japanese losses </Li> <Li> 2.7 Possible third wave </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Ships lost or damaged <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Battleships </Li> <Li> 3.2 Ex-battleship ( target / AA training ship ) </Li> <Li> 3.3 Cruisers </Li> <Li> 3.4 Destroyers </Li> <Li> 3.5 Auxiliaries </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Salvage </Li> <Li> 5 Aftermath <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Niihau Incident </Li> <Li> 5.2 Strategic implications </Li> <Li> 5.3 Retrospective debate on American intelligence </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 In popular culture </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Background to conflict </H2> Main article : Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor <H3> Diplomatic background </H3> <P> War between Japan and the United States had been a possibility that each nation had been aware of ( and developed contingency plans for ) since the 1920s , though tensions did not begin to grow seriously until Japan 's 1931 invasion of Manchuria . Over the next decade , Japan continued to expand into China , leading to all - out war between those countries in 1937 . Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and achieve sufficient resource independence to attain victory on the mainland ; the `` Southern Operation '' was designed to assist these efforts . </P> Pearl Harbor on October 30 , 1941 , looking southwest <P> From December 1937 , events such as the Japanese attack on USS Panay , the Allison incident , and the Nanking Massacre ( the International Military Tribunal of the Far East concluded that more than 200,000 Chinese non-combatants were killed in indiscriminate massacres , though other estimates have ranged from 40,000 to more than 300,000 ) swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan . Fearing Japanese expansion , the United States , the United Kingdom , and France provided loan assistance for war supply contracts to China . </P> <P> In 1940 , Japan invaded French Indochina in an effort to control supplies reaching China . The United States halted shipments of airplanes , parts , machine tools , and aviation gasoline to Japan , which was perceived by Japan as an unfriendly act . The U.S. did not stop oil exports to Japan at that time in part because prevailing sentiment in Washington was that such an action would be an extreme step that Japan would likely consider a provocation , given Japanese dependence on U.S. oil . </P> <P> Early in 1941 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved the Pacific Fleet to Hawaii from its previous base in San Diego and ordered a military buildup in the Philippines in the hope of discouraging Japanese aggression in the Far East . Because the Japanese high command was ( mistakenly ) certain that any attack on the UK 's Southeast Asian colonies , including Singapore , would bring the U.S. into war , a devastating preventive strike appeared to be the only way to avoid U.S. naval interference . An invasion of the Philippines was also considered necessary by Japanese war planners . The U.S. War Plan Orange had envisioned defending the Philippines with a 40,000 - man elite force . This was opposed by Douglas MacArthur , who felt that he would need a force ten times that size , and was never implemented . By 1941 , U.S. planners anticipated abandonment of the Philippines at the outbreak of war and orders to that effect were given in late 1941 to Admiral Thomas Hart , commander of the Asiatic Fleet . </P> <P> The U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan in July 1941 , following Japanese expansion into French Indochina after the Fall of France , in part because of new American restrictions on domestic oil consumption . This in turn caused the Japanese to proceed with plans to take the Dutch East Indies , an oil - rich territory . On August 17 , Roosevelt warned Japan that the U.S. was prepared to take steps against Japan if it attacked `` neighboring countries '' . The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource - rich , European - controlled colonies of Southeast Asia . </P> <P> Japan and the U.S. engaged in negotiations during the course of 1941 in an effort to improve relations . During these negotiations , Japan offered to withdraw from most of China and Indochina when peace was made with the Nationalist government , adopt an independent interpretation of the Tripartite Pact , and not to discriminate in trade provided all other countries reciprocated . Washington rejected these proposals . Japanese Prime Minister Konoye then offered to meet with Roosevelt , but Roosevelt insisted on coming to an agreement before any meeting . The U.S. ambassador to Japan repeatedly urged Roosevelt to accept the meeting , warning that it was the only way to preserve the conciliatory Konoye government and peace in the Pacific . His recommendation was not acted upon . The Konoye government collapsed the following month when the Japanese military refused to agree to the withdrawal of all troops from China . </P> <P> Japan 's final proposal , on November 20 , offered to withdraw their forces from southern Indochina and not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia provided that the U.S. , the UK , and the Netherlands ceased aiding China and lifted their sanctions against Japan . The American counter-proposal of November 26 ( November 27 in Japan ) ( the Hull note ) required Japan to evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with Pacific powers . However the day before the Hull Note was delivered , on November 26 in Japan , the main Japanese attack fleet left port for Pearl Harbor . </P> <H3> Military planning </H3> <P> Preliminary planning for an attack on Pearl Harbor to protect the move into the `` Southern Resource Area '' ( the Japanese term for the Dutch East Indies and Southeast Asia generally ) had begun very early in 1941 under the auspices of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , then commanding Japan 's Combined Fleet . He won assent to formal planning and training for an attack from the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff only after much contention with Naval Headquarters , including a threat to resign his command . Full - scale planning was underway by early spring 1941 , primarily by Rear Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka , with assistance from Captain Minoru Genda and Yamamoto 's Deputy Chief of Staff , Captain Kameto Kuroshima . The planners studied the 1940 British air attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto intensively . </P> <P> Over the next several months , pilots were trained , equipment was adapted , and intelligence was collected . Despite these preparations , Emperor Hirohito did not approve the attack plan until November 5 , after the third of four Imperial Conferences called to consider the matter . Final authorization was not given by the emperor until December 1 , after a majority of Japanese leaders advised him the `` Hull Note '' would `` destroy the fruits of the China incident , endanger Manchukuo and undermine Japanese control of Korea . '' </P> <P> By late 1941 , many observers believed that hostilities between the U.S. and Japan were imminent . A Gallup poll just before the attack on Pearl Harbor found that 52 % of Americans expected war with Japan , 27 % did not , and 21 % had no opinion . While U.S. Pacific bases and facilities had been placed on alert on many occasions , U.S. officials doubted Pearl Harbor would be the first target ; instead , they expected the Philippines would be attacked first . This presumption was due to the threat that the air bases throughout the country and the naval base at Manila posed to sea lanes , as well as to the shipment of supplies to Japan from territory to the south . They also incorrectly believed that Japan was not capable of mounting more than one major naval operation at a time . </P> <H3> Objectives </H3> <P> The Japanese attack had several major aims . First , it intended to destroy important American fleet units , thereby preventing the Pacific Fleet from interfering with Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies and Malaya and to enable Japan to conquer Southeast Asia without interference . Second , it was hoped to buy time for Japan to consolidate its position and increase its naval strength before shipbuilding authorized by the 1940 Vinson - Walsh Act erased any chance of victory . Third , to deliver a blow to America 's ability to mobilize its forces in the Pacific , battleships were chosen as the main targets , since they were the prestige ships of any navy at the time . Finally , it was hoped that the attack would undermine American morale such that the U.S. government would drop its demands contrary to Japanese interests , and would seek a compromise peace with Japan . </P> <P> Striking the Pacific Fleet at anchor in Pearl Harbor carried two distinct disadvantages : the targeted ships would be in very shallow water , so it would be relatively easy to salvage and possibly repair them ; and most of the crews would survive the attack , since many would be on shore leave or would be rescued from the harbor . A further important disadvantage -- this of timing , and known to the Japanese -- was the absence from Pearl Harbor of all three of the U.S. Pacific Fleet 's aircraft carriers ( Enterprise , Lexington , and Saratoga ) . IJN top command was so imbued with Admiral Mahan 's `` Decisive battle '' doctrine -- especially that of destroying the maximum number of battleships -- that , despite these concerns , Yamamoto decided to press ahead . </P> <P> Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short , victorious war also meant other targets in the harbor , especially the navy yard , oil tank farms , and submarine base , were ignored , since -- by their thinking -- the war would be over before the influence of these facilities would be felt . </P> <H2> Approach and attack </H2> See also : Order of battle of the Attack on Pearl Harbor Route followed by the Japanese fleet to Pearl Harbor and back An Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter on the aircraft carrier Akagi <P> On November 26 , 1941 , a Japanese task force ( the Striking Force ) of six aircraft carriers -- Akagi , Kaga , Sōryū , Hiryū , Shōkaku , and Zuikaku -- departed northern Japan en route to a position northwest of Hawaii , intending to launch its 408 aircraft to attack Pearl Harbor : 360 for the two attack waves and 48 on defensive combat air patrol ( CAP ) , including nine fighters from the first wave . </P> <P> The first wave was to be the primary attack , while the second wave was to attack carriers as its first objective and cruisers as its second , with battleships as the third target . The first wave carried most of the weapons to attack capital ships , mainly specially adapted Type 91 aerial torpedoes which were designed with an anti-roll mechanism and a rudder extension that let them operate in shallow water . The aircrews were ordered to select the highest value targets ( battleships and aircraft carriers ) or , if these were not present , any other high value ships ( cruisers and destroyers ) . First wave dive bombers were to attack ground targets . Fighters were ordered to strafe and destroy as many parked aircraft as possible to ensure they did not get into the air to intercept the bombers , especially in the first wave . When the fighters ' fuel got low they were to refuel at the aircraft carriers and return to combat . Fighters were to serve CAP duties where needed , especially over U.S. airfields . </P> <P> Before the attack commenced , two reconnaissance aircraft launched from cruisers Chikuma and Tone were sent to scout over Oahu and Maui and report on U.S. fleet composition and location . Reconnaissance aircraft flights risked alerting the U.S. , and were not necessary . U.S. fleet composition and preparedness information in Pearl Harbor was already known due to the reports of the Japanese spy Takeo Yoshikawa . A report of the absence of the U.S. fleet in Lahaina anchorage off Maui was received from the fleet submarine I - 72 . Another four scout planes patrolled the area between the Japanese carrier force ( the Kidō Butai ) and Niihau , to detect any counterattack . </P> <H3> Submarines </H3> <P> Fleet submarines I - 16 , I - 18 , I - 20 , I - 22 , and I - 24 each embarked a Type A midget submarine for transport to the waters off Oahu . The five I - boats left Kure Naval District on November 25 , 1941 . On December 6 , they came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of the mouth of Pearl Harbor and launched their midget subs at about 01 : 00 on December 7 . At 03 : 42 Hawaiian Time , the minesweeper Condor spotted a midget submarine periscope southwest of the Pearl Harbor entrance buoy and alerted the destroyer Ward . The midget may have entered Pearl Harbor . However , Ward sank another midget submarine at 06 : 37 in the first American shots in the Pacific Theater . A midget submarine on the north side of Ford Island missed the seaplane tender Curtiss with her first torpedo and missed the attacking destroyer Monaghan with her other one before being sunk by Monaghan at 08 : 43 . </P> <P> A third midget submarine , Ha - 19 , grounded twice , once outside the harbor entrance and again on the east side of Oahu , where it was captured on December 8 . Ensign Kazuo Sakamaki swam ashore and was captured by Hawaii National Guard Corporal David Akui , becoming the first Japanese prisoner of war . A fourth had been damaged by a depth charge attack and was abandoned by its crew before it could fire its torpedoes . Japanese forces received a radio message from a midget submarine at 00 : 41 on December 8 claiming damage to one or more large warships inside Pearl Harbor . </P> <P> In 1992 , 2000 , and 2001 , Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory 's submersibles found the wreck of the fifth midget submarine lying in three parts outside Pearl Harbor . The wreck was in the debris field where much surplus U.S. equipment was dumped after the war , including vehicles and landing craft . Both of its torpedoes were missing . This correlates with reports of two torpedoes fired at the light cruiser St. Louis at 10 : 04 at the entrance of Pearl Harbor , and a possible torpedo fired at destroyer Helm at 08 : 21 . </P> <H3> Japanese declaration of war </H3> See also : Japanese war crimes <P> The attack took place before any formal declaration of war was made by Japan , but this was not Admiral Yamamoto 's intention . He originally stipulated that the attack should not commence until thirty minutes after Japan had informed the United States that peace negotiations were at an end . However , the attack began before the notice could be delivered . Tokyo transmitted the 5000 - word notification ( commonly called the `` 14 - Part Message '' ) in two blocks to the Japanese Embassy in Washington . Transcribing the message took too long for the Japanese ambassador to deliver it on schedule ; in the event , it was not presented until more than an hour after the attack began . ( In fact , U.S. code breakers had already deciphered and translated most of the message hours before he was scheduled to deliver it . ) The final part is sometimes described as a declaration of war . While it was viewed by a number of senior U.S government and military officials as a very strong indicator negotiations were likely to be terminated and that war might break out at any moment , it neither declared war nor severed diplomatic relations . A declaration of war was printed on the front page of Japan 's newspapers in the evening edition of December 8 , but not delivered to the U.S. government until the day after the attack . </P> <P> For decades , conventional wisdom held that Japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations only because of accidents and bumbling that delayed the delivery of a document hinting at war to Washington . In 1999 , however , Takeo Iguchi , a professor of law and international relations at International Christian University in Tokyo , discovered documents that pointed to a vigorous debate inside the government over how , and indeed whether , to notify Washington of Japan 's intention to break off negotiations and start a war , including a December 7 entry in the war diary saying , `` ( O ) ur deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success . '' Of this , Iguchi said , `` The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give any proper declaration of war , or indeed prior notice even of the termination of negotiations ... and they clearly prevailed . '' </P> <P> In any event , even if the Japanese had decoded and delivered the 14 - Part Message before the beginning of the attack , it would not have constituted either a formal break of diplomatic relations or a declaration of war . The final two paragraphs of the message read : </P> <P> Thus the earnest hope of the Japanese Government to adjust Japanese - American relations and to preserve and promote the peace of the Pacific through cooperation with the American Government has finally been lost . </P> The Japanese Government regrets to have to notify hereby the American Government that in view of the attitude of the American Government it can not but consider that it is impossible to reach an agreement through further negotiations . <H3> First wave composition </H3> The Japanese attacked in two waves . The first wave was detected by U.S. Army radar at 136 nautical miles ( 252 km ) , but was misidentified as USAAF bombers arriving from the American mainland Top : A. Ford Island NAS B.

Six planes failed to launch due to technical difficulties . It included : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1st Group ( targets : battleships and aircraft carriers ) <Ul> <Li> 49 Nakajima B5N Kate bombers armed with 800 kg ( 1760 lb ) armor - piercing bombs , organized in four sections ( 1 failed to launch ) </Li> <Li> 40 B5N bombers armed with Type 91 torpedoes , also in four sections </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2nd Group -- ( targets : Ford Island and Wheeler Field ) <Ul> <Li> 51 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) general - purpose bombs ( 3 failed to launch ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3rd Group -- ( targets : aircraft at Ford Island , Hickam Field , Wheeler Field , Barber 's Point , Kaneohe ) <Ul> <Li> 43 Mitsubishi A6M `` Zero '' fighters for air control and strafing ( 2 failed to launch ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> As the first wave approached Oahu , it was detected by the U.S. Army SCR - 270 radar at Opana Point near the island 's northern tip . This post had been in training mode for months , but was not yet operational . The operators , Privates George Elliot Jr. and Joseph Lockard , reported a target . But Lieutenant Kermit A. Tyler , a newly assigned officer at the thinly manned Intercept Center , presumed it was the scheduled arrival of six B - 17 bombers from California . The Japanese planes were approaching from a direction very close ( only a few degrees difference ) to the bombers , and while the operators had never seen a formation as large on radar , they neglected to tell Tyler of its size . Tyler , for security reasons , could not tell the operators of the six B - 17s that were due ( even though it was widely known ) . </P> <P> As the first wave planes approached Oahu , they encountered and shot down several U.S. aircraft . At least one of these radioed a somewhat incoherent warning . Other warnings from ships off the harbor entrance were still being processed or awaiting confirmation when the attacking planes began bombing and strafing . Nevertheless , it is not clear any warnings would have had much effect even if they had been interpreted correctly and much more promptly . The results the Japanese achieved in the Philippines were essentially the same as at Pearl Harbor , though MacArthur had almost nine hours warning that the Japanese had already attacked Pearl Harbor . </P> <P> The air portion of the attack began at 7 : 48 a.m. Hawaiian Time ( 3 : 18 a.m. December 8 Japanese Standard Time , as kept by ships of the Kido Butai ) , with the attack on Kaneohe . A total of 353 Japanese planes in two waves reached Oahu . Slow , vulnerable torpedo bombers led the first wave , exploiting the first moments of surprise to attack the most important ships present ( the battleships ) , while dive bombers attacked U.S. air bases across Oahu , starting with Hickam Field , the largest , and Wheeler Field , the main U.S. Army Air Forces fighter base . The 171 planes in the second wave attacked the Army Air Forces ' Bellows Field near Kaneohe on the windward side of the island , and Ford Island . The only aerial opposition came from a handful of P - 36 Hawks , P - 40 Warhawks , and some SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the carrier Enterprise . </P> A destroyed Vindicator at Ewa field , the victim of one of the smaller attacks on the approach to Pearl Harbor <P> In the first wave attack , about eight of the forty - nine 800 kg ( 1760 lb ) armor - piercing bombs dropped hit their intended battleship targets . At least two of those bombs broke up on impact , another detonated before penetrating an unarmored deck , and one was a dud . Thirteen of the forty torpedoes hit battleships , and four torpedoes hit other ships . Men aboard U.S. ships awoke to the sounds of alarms , bombs exploding , and gunfire , prompting bleary - eyed men to dress as they ran to General Quarters stations . ( The famous message , `` Air raid Pearl Harbor . This is not drill . '' , was sent from the headquarters of Patrol Wing Two , the first senior Hawaiian command to respond . ) The defenders were very unprepared . Ammunition lockers were locked , aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip in the open to prevent sabotage , guns unmanned ( none of the Navy 's 5 `` / 38s , only a quarter of its machine guns , and only four of 31 Army batteries got in action ) . Despite this low alert status , many American military personnel responded effectively during the attack . Ensign Joe Taussig Jr. , aboard Nevada , commanded the ship 's antiaircraft guns and was severely wounded , but continued to be on post . Lt. Commander F.J. Thomas commanded Nevada in the captain 's absence and got her under way until the ship was grounded at 9 : 10 a.m. One of the destroyers , Aylwin , got underway with only four officers aboard , all ensigns , none with more than a year 's sea duty ; she operated at sea for 36 hours before her commanding officer managed to get back aboard . Captain Mervyn Bennion , commanding West Virginia , led his men until he was cut down by fragments from a bomb which hit Tennessee , moored alongside . </P> <H3> Second wave composition </H3> <P> The second planned wave consisted of 171 planes : 54 B5Ns , 81 D3As , and 36 A6Ms , commanded by Lieutenant - Commander Shigekazu Shimazaki . Four planes failed to launch because of technical difficulties . This wave and its targets comprised : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1st Group -- 54 B5Ns armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) and 132 lb ( 60 kg ) general - purpose bombs <Ul> <Li> 27 B5Ns -- aircraft and hangars on Kaneohe , Ford Island , and Barbers Point </Li> <Li> 27 B5Ns -- hangars and aircraft on Hickam Field </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2nd Group ( targets : aircraft carriers and cruisers ) <Ul> <Li> 78 D3As armed with 550 lb ( 249 kg ) general - purpose bombs , in four sections ( 3 aborted ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3rd Group -- ( targets : aircraft at Ford Island , Hickam Field , Wheeler Field , Barber 's Point , Kaneohe ) <Ul> <Li> 35 A6Ms for defense and strafing ( 1 aborted ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> The second wave was divided into three groups . One was tasked to attack Kāne ʻohe , the rest Pearl Harbor proper . The separate sections arrived at the attack point almost simultaneously from several directions . </P> <H3> American casualties and damage </H3> <P> Ninety minutes after it began , the attack was over . 2,008 sailors were killed and 710 others wounded ; 218 soldiers and airmen ( who were part of the Army until the independent U.S. Air Force was formed in 1947 ) were killed and 364 wounded ; 109 marines were killed and 69 wounded ; and 68 civilians were killed and 35 wounded . In total , 2,403 Americans died and 1,178 were wounded . Eighteen ships were sunk or run aground , including five battleships . All of the Americans killed or wounded during the attack were non-combatants , given the fact there was no state of war when the attack occurred . </P> USS Arizona during the attack USS Nevada , on fire and down at the bow , attempting to leave the harbor before being deliberately beached <P> Of the American fatalities , nearly half were due to the explosion of Arizona 's forward magazine after it was hit by a modified 16 - inch ( 410 mm ) shell . </P> <P> Already damaged by a torpedo and on fire amidships , Nevada attempted to exit the harbor . She was targeted by many Japanese bombers as she got under way and sustained more hits from 250 lb ( 113 kg ) bombs , which started further fires . She was deliberately beached to avoid blocking the harbor entrance . </P> <P> California was hit by two bombs and two torpedoes . The crew might have kept her afloat , but were ordered to abandon ship just as they were raising power for the pumps . Burning oil from Arizona and West Virginia drifted down on her , and probably made the situation look worse than it was . The disarmed target ship Utah was holed twice by torpedoes . West Virginia was hit by seven torpedoes , the seventh tearing away her rudder . Oklahoma was hit by four torpedoes , the last two above her belt armor , which caused her to capsize . Maryland was hit by two of the converted 16 '' shells , but neither caused serious damage . </P> <P> Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships ( the largest vessels present ) , they did not ignore other targets . The light cruiser Helena was torpedoed , and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer Oglala . Two destroyers in dry dock , Cassin and Downes were destroyed when bombs penetrated their fuel bunkers . The leaking fuel caught fire ; flooding the dry dock in an effort to fight fire made the burning oil rise , and both were burned out . Cassin slipped from her keel blocks and rolled against Downes . The light cruiser Raleigh was holed by a torpedo . The light cruiser Honolulu was damaged , but remained in service . The repair vessel Vestal , moored alongside Arizona , was heavily damaged and beached . The seaplane tender Curtiss was also damaged . The destroyer Shaw was badly damaged when two bombs penetrated her forward magazine . </P> This message denotes the first U.S. ship , St. Louis to clear Pearl Harbor . ( National Archives and Records Administration ) ( Note that this is in answer to question `` Is channel clear ? '' and faint writing at bottom concerning the answer being held until St. Louis had successfully cleared . ) <P> Of the 402 American aircraft in Hawaii , 188 were destroyed and 159 damaged , 155 of them on the ground . Almost none were actually ready to take off to defend the base . Eight Army Air Forces pilots managed to get airborne during the attack and six were credited with downing at least one Japanese aircraft during the attack : 1st Lt. Lewis M. Sanders , 2nd Lt. Philip M. Rasmussen , 2nd Lt. Kenneth M. Taylor , 2nd Lt. George S. Welch , 2nd Lt. Harry W. Brown , and 2nd Lt. Gordon H. Sterling Jr . Sterling was shot down by Lt. Fujita over Kaneohe Bay and is listed as Body Not Recovered ( not Missing In Action ) . Lt. John L. Dains was killed by friendly fire returning from a victory over Kaawa . Of 33 PBYs in Hawaii , 24 were destroyed , and six others damaged beyond repair . ( The three on patrol returned undamaged . ) Friendly fire brought down some U.S. planes on top of that , including five from an inbound flight from Enterprise . Japanese attacks on barracks killed additional personnel . </P> <P> At the time of the attack , nine civilian aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor . Of these , three were shot down . </P> <H3> Japanese losses </H3> <P> Fifty - five Japanese airmen and nine submariners were killed in the attack , and one was captured . Of Japan 's 414 available planes , 29 were lost during the battle ( nine in the first attack wave , 20 in the second ) , with another 74 damaged by antiaircraft fire from the ground . </P> <H3> Possible third wave </H3> <P> Several Japanese junior officers including Fuchida and Genda urged Nagumo to carry out a third strike in order to destroy as much of Pearl Harbor 's fuel and torpedo storage , maintenance , and dry dock facilities as possible . Genda , who had unsuccessfully advocated for invading Hawaii after the air attack , believed that without an invasion three strikes were necessary to disable the base as much as possible . The captains of the other five carriers in the task force reported they were willing and ready to carry out a third strike . Military historians have suggested the destruction of these shore facilities would have hampered the U.S. Pacific Fleet far more seriously than the loss of its battleships . If they had been wiped out , `` serious ( American ) operations in the Pacific would have been postponed for more than a year '' ; according to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , later Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet , `` it would have prolonged the war another two years . '' Nagumo , however , decided to withdraw for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> American anti-aircraft performance had improved considerably during the second strike , and two thirds of Japan 's losses were incurred during the second wave . </Li> <Li> Nagumo felt if he launched a third strike , he would be risking three quarters of the Combined Fleet 's strength to wipe out the remaining targets ( which included the facilities ) while suffering higher aircraft losses . </Li> <Li> The location of the American carriers remained unknown . In addition , the admiral was concerned his force was now within range of American land - based bombers . Nagumo was uncertain whether the U.S. had enough surviving planes remaining on Hawaii to launch an attack against his carriers . </Li> <Li> A third wave would have required substantial preparation and turnaround time , and would have meant returning planes would have had to land at night . At the time , only the Royal Navy had developed night carrier techniques , so this was a substantial risk . </Li> <Li> The task force 's fuel situation did not permit him to remain in waters north of Pearl Harbor much longer , since he was at the very limit of logistical support . To do so risked running unacceptably low on fuel , perhaps even having to abandon destroyers en route home . </Li> <Li> He believed the second strike had essentially satisfied the main objective of his mission -- the neutralization of the Pacific Fleet -- and did not wish to risk further losses . Moreover , it was Japanese Navy practice to prefer the conservation of strength over the total destruction of the enemy . </Li> </Ul> <P> At a conference aboard Yamato the following morning , Yamamoto initially supported Nagumo . In retrospect , sparing the vital dockyards , maintenance shops , and oil depots meant the U.S. could respond relatively quickly to Japanese activities in the Pacific . Yamamoto later regretted Nagumo 's decision to withdraw and categorically stated it had been a great mistake not to order a third strike . </P> <H2> Ships lost or damaged </H2> <P> Seventeen ships were damaged or lost in the attack , of which fourteen were repaired and returned to service . </P> <H3> Battleships </H3> <Ul> <Li> Arizona ( RADM Kidd 's flagship of Battleship Division One ) : hit by four armor - piercing bombs , exploded ; total loss . 1,177 dead . </Li> <Li> Oklahoma : hit by five torpedoes , capsized ; total loss . 429 dead . </Li> <Li> West Virginia : hit by two bombs , seven torpedoes , sunk ; returned to service July 1944 . 106 dead . </Li> <Li> California : hit by two bombs , two torpedoes , sunk ; returned to service January 1944 . 100 dead . </Li> <Li> Nevada : hit by six bombs , one torpedo , beached ; returned to service October 1942 . 60 dead . </Li> <Li> Pennsylvania ( ADM Kimmel 's flagship of the United States Pacific Fleet ) : in drydock with Cassin and Downes , hit by one bomb and debris from USS Cassin ; remained in service . 9 dead . </Li> <Li> Tennessee : hit by two bombs ; returned to service February 1942 . 5 dead . </Li> <Li> Maryland : hit by two bombs ; returned to service February 1942 . 4 dead ( including floatplane pilot shot down ) . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Ex-battleship ( target / aa training ship ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Utah : hit by two torpedoes , capsized ; total loss . 64 dead . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Cruisers </H3> <Ul> <Li> Helena : hit by one torpedo ; returned to service January 1942 . 20 dead . </Li> <Li> Raleigh : hit by one torpedo ; returned to service February 1942 . </Li> <Li> Honolulu : Near miss , light damage ; remained in service . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Destroyers </H3> <Ul> <Li> Cassin : in drydock with Downes and Pennsylvania , hit by one bomb , burned ; returned to service February 1944 . </Li> <Li> Downes : in drydock with Cassin and Pennsylvania , caught fire from Cassin , burned ; returned to service November 1943 . </Li> <Li> Shaw : hit by three bombs ; returned to service June 1942 . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Auxiliaries </H3> <Ul> <Li> Oglala ( minelayer ) : Damaged by torpedo hit on Helena , capsized ; returned to service ( as engine - repair ship ) February 1944 . </Li> <Li> Vestal ( repair ship ) : hit by two bombs , blast and fire from Arizona , beached ; returned to service by August 1942 . </Li> <Li> Curtiss ( seaplane tender ) : hit by one bomb , one crashed Japanese aircraft ; returned to service January 1942 . 19 dead . </Li> <Li> Sotoyomo ( harbor tug ) : damaged by explosion and fires in Shaw ; sunk ; returned to service August 1942 . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Salvage </H2> Captain Homer N. Wallin ( center ) supervises salvage operations aboard USS California , early 1942 <P> After a systematic search for survivors , formal salvage operations began . Captain Homer N. Wallin , Material Officer for Commander , Battle Force , U.S. Pacific Fleet , was immediately ordered to lead salvage operations . `` Within a short time I was relieved of all other duties and ordered to full time work as Fleet Salvage Officer . '' </P> <P> Around Pearl Harbor , divers from the Navy ( shore and tenders ) , the Naval Shipyard , and civilian contractors ( Pacific Bridge and others ) began work on the ships that could be refloated . They patched holes , cleared debris , and pumped water out of ships . Navy divers worked inside the damaged ships . Within six months , five battleships and two cruisers were patched or refloated so they could be sent to shipyards in Pearl Harbor and on the mainland for extensive repair . </P> <P> Intensive salvage operations continued for another year , a total of some 20,000 man - hours under water . Oklahoma , while successfully raised , was never repaired , and capsized while under tow to the mainland in 1947 . Arizona and the target ship Utah were too heavily damaged for salvage , though much of their armament and equipment was removed and put to use aboard other vessels . Today , the two hulks remain where they were sunk , with Arizona becoming a war memorial . </P> <H2> Aftermath </H2> Main article : Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor U.S. President Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan on December 8 , 1941 <P> In the wake of the attack , 15 Medals of Honor , 51 Navy Crosses , 53 Silver Stars , four Navy and Marine Corps Medals , one Distinguished Flying Cross , four Distinguished Service Crosses , one Distinguished Service Medal , and three Bronze Star Medals were awarded to the American servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat at Pearl Harbor . Additionally , a special military award , the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal , was later authorized for all military veterans of the attack . </P> <P> The day after the attack , Roosevelt delivered his famous Infamy Speech to a Joint Session of Congress , calling for a formal declaration of war on the Empire of Japan . Congress obliged his request less than an hour later . On December 11 , Germany and Italy declared war on the United States , even though the Tripartite Pact did not require it . Congress issued a declaration of war against Germany and Italy later that same day . The UK actually declared war on Japan nine hours before the U.S. did , partially due to Japanese attacks on Malaya , Singapore and Hong Kong , and partially due to Winston Churchill 's promise to declare war `` within the hour '' of a Japanese attack on the United States . </P> Pennsylvania , behind the wreckage of Downes and Cassin <P> The attack was an initial shock to all the Allies in the Pacific Theater . Further losses compounded the alarming setback . Japan attacked the Philippines hours later ( because of the time difference , it was December 8 in the Philippines ) . Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor , the battleships Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk off the coast of Malaya , causing British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later to recollect `` In all the war I never received a more direct shock . As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me . There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California . Over this vast expanse of waters Japan was supreme and we everywhere were weak and naked '' . </P> Remember December 7th ! propaganda issued in 1942 <P> Throughout the war , Pearl Harbor was frequently used in American propaganda . </P> <P> One further consequence of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its aftermath ( notably the Niihau incident ) was that Japanese American residents and citizens were relocated to nearby Japanese - American internment camps . Within hours of the attack , hundreds of Japanese American leaders were rounded up and brought to high - security camps such as Sand Island at the mouth of Honolulu harbor and Kilauea Military Camp on the island of Hawaii . Eventually , more than 110,000 Japanese Americans , nearly all who lived on the West Coast , were forced into interior camps , but in Hawaii , where the 150,000 - plus Japanese Americans composed over one - third of the population , only 1,200 to 1,800 were interned . </P> <P> The attack also had international consequences . The Canadian province of British Columbia , bordering the Pacific Ocean , had long had a large population of Japanese immigrants and their Japanese Canadian descendants . Pre-war tensions were exacerbated by the Pearl Harbor attack , leading to a reaction from the Government of Canada . On February 24 , 1942 , Order - in - Council P.C. no . 1486 was passed under the War Measures Act allowing for the forced removal of any and all Canadians of Japanese descent from British Columbia , as well as the prohibiting from them returning to the province . On 4 March , regulations under the Act were adopted to evacuate Japanese - Canadians . As a result , 12,000 were interned in interior camps , 2,000 were sent to road camps and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies at sugar beet farms . </P> Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi 's aircraft shown ten days after it crashed <H3> Niihau incident </H3> Main article : Niihau incident <P> The Japanese planners had determined that some means was required for rescuing fliers whose aircraft were too badly damaged to return to the carriers . The island of Niihau , only 30 minutes flying time from Pearl Harbor , was designated as the rescue point . </P> <P> The Zero flown by Petty Officer Shigenori Nishikaichi of Hiryu was damaged in the attack on Wheeler , so he flew to the rescue point on Niihau . The aircraft was further damaged on landing . Nishikaichi was helped from the wreckage by one of the native Hawaiians , who , aware of the tension between the United States and Japan , took the pilot 's maps and other documents . The island 's residents had no telephones or radio and were completely unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor . Nishikaichi enlisted the support of three Japanese - American residents in an attempt to recover the documents . During the ensuing struggles , Nishikaichi was killed and a Hawaiian civilian was wounded ; one collaborator committed suicide , and his wife and the third collaborator were sent to prison . </P> <P> The ease with which the local ethnic Japanese residents had apparently gone to the assistance of Nishikaichi was a source of concern for many , and tended to support those who believed that local Japanese could not be trusted . </P> <H3> Strategic implications </H3> <P> Admiral Hara Tadaichi summed up the Japanese result by saying , `` We won a great tactical victory at Pearl Harbor and thereby lost the war . '' To a similar effect , see Isoroku Yamamoto 's alleged `` sleeping giant '' quote . </P> <P> While the attack accomplished its intended objective , it turned out to be largely unnecessary . Unbeknownst to Yamamoto , who conceived the original plan , the U.S. Navy had decided as far back as 1935 to abandon ' charging ' across the Pacific towards the Philippines in response to an outbreak of war ( in keeping with the evolution of Plan Orange ) . The U.S. instead adopted `` Plan Dog '' in 1940 , which emphasized keeping the IJN out of the eastern Pacific and away from the shipping lanes to Australia , while the U.S. concentrated on defeating Nazi Germany . </P> <P> Fortunately for the United States , the American aircraft carriers were untouched by the Japanese attack ; otherwise the Pacific Fleet 's ability to conduct offensive operations would have been crippled for a year or more ( given no diversions from the Atlantic Fleet ) . As it was , the elimination of the battleships left the U.S. Navy with no choice but to rely on its aircraft carriers and submarines -- the very weapons with which the U.S. Navy halted and eventually reversed the Japanese advance . While six of the eight battleships were repaired and returned to service , their relatively low speed and high fuel consumption limited their deployment , and they served mainly in shore bombardment roles ( their only major action being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944 ) . A major flaw of Japanese strategic thinking was a belief that the ultimate Pacific battle would be fought by battleships , in keeping with the doctrine of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan . As a result , Yamamoto ( and his successors ) hoarded battleships for a `` decisive battle '' that never happened . </P> <P> The Japanese confidence in their ability to achieve a short , victorious war meant that they neglected Pearl Harbor 's navy repair yards , oil tank farms , submarine base , and old headquarters building . All of these targets were omitted from Genda 's list , yet they proved more important than any battleship to the American war efforts in the Pacific . The survival of the repair shops and fuel depots allowed Pearl Harbor to maintain logistical support to the U.S. Navy 's operations , such as the Battles of Coral Sea and Midway . It was submarines that immobilized the Imperial Japanese Navy 's heavy ships and brought Japan 's economy to a virtual standstill by crippling the transportation of oil and raw materials : by the end of 1942 , import of raw materials was cut to half of what it had been , `` to a disastrous ten million tons '' , while oil import `` was almost completely stopped '' . Lastly , the basement of the Old Administration Building was the home of the cryptanalytic unit which contributed significantly to the Midway ambush and the Submarine Force 's success . </P> <H3> Retrospective debate on American intelligence </H3> Main article : Pearl Harbor advance - knowledge conspiracy theory <P> Ever since the Japanese attack , there has been debate as to how and why the United States had been caught unaware , and how much and when American officials knew of Japanese plans and related topics . Military officers including Gen. Billy Mitchell had pointed out the vulnerability of Pearl to air attack . At least two Naval War games , one in 1932 and another in 1936 , proved that Pearl was vulnerable to such an attack . Admiral James Richardson was removed from command shortly after protesting President Roosevelt 's decision to move the bulk of the Pacific fleet to Pearl Harbor . The decisions of military and political leadership to ignore these warnings has contributed to conspiracy theories . Several writers , including journalist Robert Stinnett and former United States rear admiral Robert Alfred Theobald , have argued that various parties high in the U.S. and British governments knew of the attack in advance and may even have let it happen or encouraged it in order to force the U.S. into war via the so - called `` back door '' . However , this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians . </P> <H2> In popular culture </H2> Main article : Attack on Pearl Harbor in popular culture <H2> See also </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Battle of Taranto </Li> <Li> Operation K </Li> <Li> Air warfare of World War II </Li> <Li> Attack on Howland Island </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> List of United States Navy ships present at Pearl Harbor , December 7 , 1941 </Li> <Li> List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Attack on Pearl Harbor </Li> <Li> Nagai Kita </Li> <Li> Edwin T.

There is , however , no doubt that they did know , as did the Japanese . Lt. Cdr .

Mitsuo Fuchida about his observations . Fuchida led the Japanese attack on December 7 , 1941 . '' </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` A torpedo bomber needed a long , level flight , and when released , its conventional torpedo would plunge nearly a hundred feet deep before swerving upward to strike a hull . Pearl Harbor deep averages 42 feet . But the Japanese borrowed an idea from the British carrier - based torpedo raid on the Italian naval base of Taranto . They fashioned auxiliary wooden tail fins to keep the torpedoes horizontal , so they would dive to only 35 feet , and they added a breakaway `` nosecone '' of soft wood to cushion the impact with the surface of the water .
