</tr> </table> <p> hurricane matthew was the first category 5 atlantic hurricane since hurricane felix in 2007 , which also caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in haiti , and spread widespread damage in the southeastern united states . the deadliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane stan in 2005 , matthew was the thirteenth named storm , fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season . it caused extensive damage to landmasses in the greater antilles , and severe damage in several islands of the bahamas who were still recovering from hurricane joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier . at one point , the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of category 3 or higher intensity to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005 , but matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the floridian coastline . </p> <p> originating from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on september 22 , matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on september 28 . it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on september 29 , before undergoing explosive intensification , ultimately reaching category 5 intensity on october 1 at just 13.4 ° n latitude -- the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin , breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 . matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles , remaining a strong category 4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haiti \\'s tiburon peninsula early on october 4 , and then a second one in cuba later that day . matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest , making landfall in the northern bahamas . the storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern united states over the next 36 hours , gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the cape romain national wildlife refuge near myrtle beach , south carolina as a category 1 hurricane on the morning of october 8 . matthew re-emerged into the atlantic shortly afterward , eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from cape hatteras , north carolina on october 9 . </p> <p> widespread effects were felt from matthew across its destructive path , however , the most significant impacts were felt in haiti , with us $1.9 billion in damage and 546 deaths , making matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake . the combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land ; around 80 % of jérémie sustained significant damage . four people were killed in cuba due to a bridge collapse , and total losses in the country amounted to us $2.58 billion , most of which occurred in the guantánamo province . passing through the bahamas as a major hurricane , matthew spread damage across several islands . grand bahama was hit directly , where most homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock . preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as matthew approached , with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties ; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding , especially in the jacksonville metropolitan area . in florida , over 1 million lost power as the storm passed to the east , with 478,000 losing power in georgia and south carolina . while damage was primarily confined to the coast in florida and georgia , torrential rains spread inland in the carolinas and virginia , causing widespread flooding . </p> <p> </p> <h2> contents </h2> ( hide ) <ul> <li> 1 meteorological history <ul> <li> 1.1 records </li> </ul> </li> <li> 2 preparations <ul> <li> 2.1

approached the lesser antilles on september 27 , the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone , as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center . however , by 12 : 00 utc on september 28 , the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados , hence becoming a tropical storm , and was assigned the name matthew . continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge , the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18 : 00 utc on september 29 . the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day , and matthew began a period of explosive intensification ; during a 24 - hour period beginning at 00 : 00 utc on september 30 , the cyclone \\'s maximum winds more than doubled , from 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) to 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) , making matthew a category 5 hurricane , the first since hurricane felix in 2007 ; the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the atlantic since records began . due to upwelling of cooler waters , matthew weakened to a category 4 hurricane later on october 1 , before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) late on october 2 . </p> <p> slowly rounding the ridge , matthew fluctuated in intensity within the category 4 range from october 1 -- 5 . intensification resumed again late on october 3 and culminated when matthew made landfall near les anglais , haiti , around 11 : 00 utc on october 4 with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) and a pressure of 934 millibars ( 27.6 inhg ) , making it the strongest to hit haiti since hurricane cleo in 1964 . continuing northward , the hurricane struck maisí in cuba early on october 5 as a slightly weaker storm . cuba \\'s and haiti \\'s mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3 status , as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the bahamas . restrengthening occurred as matthew \\'s circulation became better organized , with the storm becoming a category 4 hurricane again while passing freeport . however , matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place . the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia , with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a category 3 hurricane ( with the strongest winds remaining just offshore ) . matthew weakened to a category 2 hurricane late on october 7 and then to a category 1 hurricane by 12 : 00 utc on october 8 . </p> the eye of hurricane matthew seen from the international space station on october 3 . <p> around 15 : 00 utc on october 8 , the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge , near mcclellanville , south carolina , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a central pressure of 963 mbar ( 28.4 inhg ) , which made it the strongest to strike the united states in terms of pressure since hurricane isaac in 2012 , and the first hurricane to make landfall north of florida in october since hurricane hazel in 1954 . convection became displaced from the center as matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear , with the nhc declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200 mi ( 320 km ) east of cape hatteras , north carolina , on october 9 . the remnants persisted for another day , before they were absorbed by a cold front . </p> <h3> records ( edit ) </h3> <p> matthew set several records during its long and destructive journey . matthew intensified into a category 5 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4 degrees north , breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 , which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7 degrees north . matthew also maintained at least category 4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of october , according to phil klotzbach of colorado state university , doing so for roughly 5 days . </p> <h2> preparations ( edit ) </h2> tropical storm

</table> <p> hurricane matthew was the first category 5 atlantic hurricane since hurricane felix in 2007 , which also caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in haiti , and spread widespread damage in the southeastern united states . the deadliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane stan in 2005 , matthew was the thirteenth named storm , fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season . it caused extensive damage to landmasses in the greater antilles , and severe damage in several islands of the bahamas who were still recovering from hurricane joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier . at one point , the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of category 3 or higher intensity to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005 , but matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the floridian coastline . </p> <p> originating from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on september 22 , matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on september 28 . it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on september 29 , before undergoing explosive intensification , ultimately reaching category 5 intensity on october 1 at just 13.4 ° n latitude -- the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin , breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 . matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles , remaining a strong category 4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haiti 's tiburon peninsula early on october 4 , and then a second one in cuba later that day . matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest , making landfall in the northern bahamas . the storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern united states over the next 36 hours , gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the cape romain national wildlife refuge near myrtle beach , south carolina as a category 1 hurricane on the morning of october 8 . matthew re-emerged into the atlantic shortly afterward , eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from cape hatteras , north carolina on october 9 . </p> <p> widespread effects were felt from matthew across its destructive path , however , the most significant impacts were felt in haiti , with us $1.9 billion in damage and 546 deaths , making matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake . the combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land ; around 80 % of jérémie sustained significant damage . four people were killed in cuba due to a bridge collapse , and total losses in the country amounted to us $2.58 billion , most of which occurred in the guantánamo province . passing through the bahamas as a major hurricane , matthew spread damage across several islands . grand bahama was hit directly , where most homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock . preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as matthew approached , with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties ; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding , especially in the jacksonville metropolitan area . in florida , over 1 million lost power as the storm passed to the east , with 478,000 losing power in georgia and south carolina . while damage was primarily confined to the coast in florida and georgia , torrential rains spread inland in the carolinas and virginia , causing widespread flooding . </p> <p> </p> <h2> contents </h2> ( hide ) <ul> <li> 1 meteorological history <ul> <li> 1.1 records </li> </ul> </li> <li> 2 preparations <ul> <li> 2.1

meteorological history of hurricane matthew map plotting the track and intensity of the storm , according to the saffir -- simpson scale <p> a vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 22 and moved rapidly across the atlantic , being monitored by the national hurricane center ( nhc ) for possible tropical cyclogenesis . despite possessing tropical - storm winds as it approached the lesser antilles on september 27 , the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone , as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center . however , by 12 : 00 utc on september 28 , the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados , hence becoming a tropical storm , and was assigned the name matthew . continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge , the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18 : 00 utc on september 29 . the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day , and matthew began a period of explosive intensification ; during a 24 - hour period beginning at 00 : 00 utc on september 30 , the cyclone 's maximum winds more than doubled , from 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) to 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) , making matthew a category 5 hurricane , the first since hurricane felix in 2007 ; the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the atlantic since records began . due to upwelling of cooler waters , matthew weakened to a category 4 hurricane later on october 1 , before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) late on october 2 . </p> <p> slowly rounding the ridge , matthew fluctuated in intensity within the category 4 range from october 1 -- 5 . intensification resumed again late on october 3 and culminated when matthew made landfall near les anglais , haiti , around 11 : 00 utc on october 4 with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) and a pressure of 934 millibars ( 27.6 inhg ) , making it the strongest to hit haiti since hurricane cleo in 1964 . continuing northward , the hurricane struck maisí in cuba early on october 5 as a slightly weaker storm . cuba 's and haiti 's mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3 status , as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the bahamas . restrengthening occurred as matthew 's circulation became better organized , with the storm becoming a category 4 hurricane again while passing freeport . however , matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place . the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia , with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a category 3 hurricane ( with the strongest winds remaining just offshore ) . matthew weakened to a category 2 hurricane late on october 7 and then to a category 1 hurricane by 12 : 00 utc on october 8 . </p> the eye of hurricane matthew seen from the international space station on october 3 . <p> around 15 : 00 utc on october 8 , the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge , near mcclellanville , south carolina , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a central pressure of 963 mbar ( 28.4 inhg ) , which made it the strongest to strike the united states in terms of pressure since hurricane isaac in 2012 , and the first hurricane to make landfall north of florida in october since hurricane hazel in 1954 . convection became displaced from the center as matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear , with the nhc declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200 mi ( 320 km ) east of cape hatteras , north carolina , on october 9 . the remnants persisted for another day , before they were absorbed by a cold front . </p> <h3> records ( edit ) </h3> <p> matthew set several records during its long and destructive journey . matthew intensified into a category 5 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4 degrees north , breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 , which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7 degrees north . matthew also maintained at least category 4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of october , according to phil klotzbach of colorado state university , doing so for roughly 5 days . </p> <h2> preparations ( edit ) </h2> tropical storm matthew over the lesser antilles , shortly after formation on september 28 <h3> lesser antilles and south america ( edit ) </h3> <p> on september 27 , prior to matthew becoming a tropical cyclone ,

six shelters were opened across the island ; 133 sought refuge in them . upon the formation of matthew as a tropical cyclone on september 28 , governments across the windward islands issued tropical storm warnings in anticipation of gale - force winds . </p> a map of forecast rainfall totals from hurricane matthew for the greater antilles and the bahamas . peak accumulations in excess of 30 in ( 760 mm ) were expected along the southern coast of haiti 's tiburon peninsula . <p> the storm 's unusual south track prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches on september 28 for aruba , bonaire , curaçao , and the northern coast of colombia from the colombia -- venezuela border to riohacha . north atlantic hurricanes affecting south america are uncommon . the watch in colombia was later upgraded to a warning on september 30 as matthew continued on a west - southwest track near the country . residents across the abc islands were advised to board their homes and stock up on supplies , leading to long lines at supermarkets and gas stations . curaçao 's government postponed the 2016 general election until october 5 . government offices in aruba closed for september 30 . a local

offices suspended operations starting on october 3 . a total of 900 shelters opened across jamaica and the urban transit company provided buses to evacuate people from kingston to the national arena . local minister desmond mckenzie warned that the infrastructure of kingston would be unable to handle the magnitude of rainfall expected . prime minister andrew holness warned residents that matthew could be more severe than hurricane gilbert which devastated the nation in 1988 . </p> <h3> haiti ( edit ) </h3> play media the animation shows hurricane matthew from september 28 to october 2 , and 3 - dimensional radar data from gpm 's dpr instrument . <p> though forecast to pass over jamaica at the time , the large extent of tropical storm - force winds prompted the issuance of a tropical storm watch for haiti 's tiburon peninsula toward the border with the dominican republic . following an eastward shift in matthew 's predicted track , a hurricane watch was issued for much of haiti on october 1 , encompassing areas from môle - saint - nicolas south to the dominican republic border ; this was upgraded to a warning just hours later . the warning eventually encompassed the entire country by the afternoon of october 2 . residents on outlying islands of haiti were evacuated to the mainland . life - threatening rainfall was forecast to affect much of the nation , with accumulations averaging 15 to 25 in ( 38 to 64 cm ) along the southern coast with isolated peaks up to 40 in ( 100 cm ) . although government officials held meetings on storm preparation , radio france internationale reported that haiti does not have the logistical capability to handle a large - scale disaster . only 576 shelters , with a collective capacity of 90,000 people , were listed for all of southern haiti . according to the international organization for migration , 55,107 internally displaced persons remained in camps or hosting sites without adequate protection from the

</h3> national hurricane center director richard knabb ( pictured ) regularly filmed briefings on the forecast and expected impacts of hurricane matthew in the united states . <p> on october 3 , the governors of florida and north carolina declared a state of emergency . the next day , south carolina governor nikki haley ordered an evacuation for those residents living within one hundred miles ( 160 km ) of the coast . interstate 26 in south carolina eastbound between the coast and columbia was reversed on wednesday to facilitate movement away from the lowcountry and charleston areas . evacuations of cape lookout national seashore in north carolina began this day as well . by october 4 , north carolina governor pat mccrory had ordered that evacuation be mandatory . a state of

positions ; at the time of matthew 's approach , the next launch was scheduled for november 4 . the kennedy space center began preparations of the facilities on october 5 . older buildings at the ksc were designed to withstand winds of 105 -- 125 mph ( 170 -- 200 km / h ) ; buildings constructed after 1992 , when category 5 hurricane andrew struck the miami area , are built to withstand 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) winds . at cape canaveral air force station , the u.s. air force 's 45th space wing began disconnecting electric power to non-essential facilities on october 4 . </p> hurricane matthew nearing florida on october 6 <p> for the fourth time in its 45 - year history , the walt disney world resort closes . its theme parks are magic kingdom , epcot , disney 's hollywood studios and disney 's animal kingdom water parks are blizzard beach and typhoon lagoon , and disney springs were closed at 5 : 00 p.m. eastern time on october 6 and did not open on october 7 . this was the first time

. florida 's governor rick scott urged over 1.5 million people to evacuate , with hurricane matthew expected to make landfall by the evening of that day . several news anchors also issued dire warnings urging floridians to evacuate . </p> <p> that same day , georgia governor nathan deal ordered a mandatory evacuation for all areas of the state east of interstate 95 , and the georgia department of public safety reversed the eastbound lanes on a portion of interstate 16 effective until the following day . </p> online response ( edit ) <p> on october 6 , the conservative news aggregator drudge report -- run by matt drudge -- headlined a five - word comment on matthew : `` storm fizzle ? matthew looks ragged !

       " <p> hurricane matthew was the first category 5 atlantic hurricane since hurricane felix in 2007 , which also caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in haiti , and spread widespread damage in the southeastern united states . the deadliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane stan in 2005 , matthew was the thirteenth named storm , fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season . it caused extensive damage to landmasses in the greater antilles , and severe damage in several islands of the bahamas who were still recovering from hurricane joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier . at one point , the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of category 3 or higher intensity to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005 , but matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the floridian coastline . </p>,\n",
       " <p> originating from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on september 22 , matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on september 28 . it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on september 29 , before undergoing explosive intensification , ultimately reaching category 5 intensity on october 1 at just 13.4 ° n latitude -- the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin , breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 . matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles , remaining a strong category 4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haiti 's tiburon peninsula early on october 4 , and then a second one in cuba later that day . matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest , making landfall in the northern bahamas . the storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern united states over the next 36 hours , gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the cape romain national wildlife refuge near myrtle beach , south carolina as a category 1 hurricane on the morning of october 8 . matthew re-emerged into the atlantic shortly afterward , eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from cape hatteras , north carolina on october 9 . </p>,\n",
       " <p> widespread effects were felt from matthew across its destructive path , however , the most significant impacts were felt in haiti , with us $1.9 billion in damage and 546 deaths , making matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake . the combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land ; around 80 % of jérémie sustained significant damage . four people were killed in cuba due to a bridge collapse , and total losses in the country amounted to us $2.58 billion , most of which occurred in the guantánamo province . passing through the bahamas as a major hurricane , matthew spread damage across several islands . grand bahama was hit directly , where most homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock . preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as matthew approached , with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties ; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding , especially in the jacksonville metropolitan area . in florida , over 1 million lost power as the storm passed to the east , with 478,000 losing power in georgia and south carolina . while damage was primarily confined to the coast in florida and georgia , torrential rains spread inland in the carolinas and virginia , causing widespread flooding . </p>,\n",
       " <p> </p>,\n",
       " <p> </p>,\n",
       " <p> a vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 22 and moved rapidly across the atlantic , being monitored by the national hurricane center ( nhc ) for possible tropical cyclogenesis . despite possessing tropical - storm winds as it approached the lesser antilles on september 27 , the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone , as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center . however , by 12 : 00 utc on september 28 , the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados , hence becoming a tropical storm , and was assigned the name matthew . continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge , the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18 : 00 utc on september 29 . the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day , and matthew began a period of explosive intensification ; during a 24 - hour period beginning at 00 : 00 utc on september 30 , the cyclone 's maximum winds more than doubled , from 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) to 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) , making matthew a category 5 hurricane , the first since hurricane felix in 2007 ; the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the atlantic since records began . due to upwelling of cooler waters , matthew weakened to a category 4 hurricane later on october 1 , before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) late on october 2 . </p>,\n",
       " <p> slowly rounding the ridge , matthew fluctuated in intensity within the category 4 range from october 1 -- 5 . intensification resumed again late on october 3 and culminated when matthew made landfall near les anglais , haiti , around 11 : 00 utc on october 4 with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) and a pressure of 934 millibars ( 27.6 inhg ) , making it the strongest to hit haiti since hurricane cleo in 1964 . continuing northward , the hurricane struck maisí in cuba early on october 5 as a slightly weaker storm . cuba 's and haiti 's mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3 status , as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the bahamas . restrengthening occurred as matthew 's circulation became better organized , with the storm becoming a category 4 hurricane again while passing freeport . however , matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place . the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia , with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a category 3 hurricane ( with the strongest winds remaining just offshore ) . matthew weakened to a category 2 hurricane late on october 7 and then to a category 1 hurricane by 12 : 00 utc on october 8 . </p>,\n",
       " <p> around 15 : 00 utc on october 8 , the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge , near mcclellanville , south carolina , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a central pressure of 963 mbar ( 28.4 inhg ) , which made it the strongest to strike the united states in terms of pressure since hurricane isaac in 2012 , and the first hurricane to make landfall north of florida in october since hurricane hazel in 1954 . convection became displaced from the center as matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear , with the nhc declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200 mi ( 320 km ) east of cape hatteras , north carolina , on october 9 . the remnants persisted for another day , before they were absorbed by a cold front . </p>,\n",
       " <p> matthew set several records during its long and destructive journey . matthew intensified into a category 5 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4 degrees north , breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 , which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7 degrees north . matthew also maintained at least category 4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of october , according to phil klotzbach of colorado state university , doing so for roughly 5 days . </p>,\n",
       " <p> on september 27 , prior to matthew becoming a tropical cyclone , liat began cancelling flights across the windward islands in anticipation of squally weather . schools and businesses were closed for the duration of matthew 's passage on september 27 and 28 on grenada , st. vincent and st. lucia ; schools in dominica suspended classes until october 3 . hewanorra international airport and george f.l. charles airport on st. lucia were closed on september 28 . six shelters were opened across the island ; 133 sought refuge in them . upon the formation of matthew as a tropical cyclone on september 28 , governments across the windward islands issued tropical storm warnings in anticipation of gale - force winds . </p>,\n",
       " <p> the storm 's unusual south track prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches on september 28 for aruba , bonaire , curaçao , and the northern coast of colombia from the colombia -- venezuela border to riohacha . north atlantic hurricanes affecting south america are uncommon . the watch in colombia was later upgraded to a warning on september 30 as matthew continued on a west - southwest track near the country . residents across the abc islands were advised to board their homes and stock up on supplies , leading to long lines at supermarkets and gas stations . curaçao 's government postponed the 2016 general election until october 5 . government offices in aruba closed for september 30 . a local sporting event , the kingdom tournament , was canceled in aruba . schools across the guajira peninsula of colombia suspended activities for september 30 . officials opened shelters and closed beaches across the peninsula . </p>,\n",
       " <p> with matthew posing a significant threat to jamaica , emergency officials ordered all fishermen on the nation 's cays and banks to evacuate to the mainland on september 29 . the following day , prime minister andrew holness held an emergency meeting regarding the hurricane and placed the government on high alert . a hurricane watch was issued for the country on september 30 , and later upgraded to a warning on october 1 . officials in trelawny parish placed 60 shelters on stand - by on october 2 . supermarkets were overwhelmed with residents stocking up on supplies , and many reported empty shelves and low supplies of bread , kerosene , and candles . many people boarded up their homes and protected their property with sand bags . one hundred female prisoners were relocated from a facility in st. catherine parish to another in kingston . toll fees along highway 2000 were to be waived during the hours before matthew 's arrival . service at both norman manley international airport and sangster international airport was scheduled to be suspended during the evening of october 2 or by the morning of october 3 . the jamaica urban transit company scheduled to suspend services beginning at 6 : 00 p.m. local time . the jamaica public service informed residents that the power grid might be shut off during the storm if conditions became severe . members of the jamaica defence force were deployed nationwide in advance of the hurricane in order to more swiftly deal with its aftermath . </p>,\n",
       " <p> schools and government offices suspended operations starting on october 3 . a total of 900 shelters opened across jamaica and the urban transit company provided buses to evacuate people from kingston to the national arena . local minister desmond mckenzie warned that the infrastructure of kingston would be unable to handle the magnitude of rainfall expected . prime minister andrew holness warned residents that matthew could be more severe than hurricane gilbert which devastated the nation in 1988 . </p>,\n",
       " <p> though forecast to pass over jamaica at the time , the large extent of tropical storm - force winds prompted the issuance of a tropical storm watch for haiti 's tiburon peninsula toward the border with the dominican republic . following an eastward shift in matthew 's predicted track , a hurricane watch was issued for much of haiti on october 1 , encompassing areas from môle - saint - nicolas south to the dominican republic border ; this was upgraded to a warning just hours later . the warning eventually encompassed the entire country by the afternoon of october 2 . residents on outlying islands of haiti were evacuated to the mainland . life - threatening rainfall was forecast to affect much of the nation , with accumulations averaging 15 to 25 in ( 38 to 64 cm ) along the southern coast with isolated peaks up to 40 in ( 100 cm ) . although government officials held meetings on storm preparation , radio france internationale reported that haiti does not have the logistical capability to handle a large - scale disaster . only 576 shelters , with a collective capacity of 90,000 people , were listed for all of southern haiti . according to the international organization for migration , 55,107 internally displaced persons remained in camps or hosting sites without adequate protection from the hurricane . </p>,\n",
       " <p> provisional president of haiti jocelerme privert addressed the nation on october 2 , urging those living along the coast and in poorly constructed homes to evacuate and comply with authorities . despite pleas from officials , many residents refused to leave their homes . schools were closed for october 3 -- 4 , though government offices remained open . nationwide , a total of 1,300 shelters were readied with a total capacity of 390,000 people . more than 18,000 volunteers and members of the red cross , community intervention teams , municipal committees , and local emergency services were readied to assist residents . at least 500 people were evacuated from jérémie . although civil protection officials took to the streets to warn people , many residents were unaware that matthew was even approaching the country a day before its expected landfall . evacuations continued through the hurricane 's landfall with the total number of people in shelters reaching 9,280 by 2 : 00 a.m. local time on october 4 . </p>,\n",
